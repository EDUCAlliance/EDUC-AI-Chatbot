The Talkbot, but the the following new features:

1. Connection to the Chat-AI API from GWDG
2. Everything that needs to be customized is now separated from the PHP script (The .env File and the llm_config File)
3. The bot now only responds when it is pinged with @name-of-bot (you can define the exact name under which the bot should be mentioned in the .env file)
