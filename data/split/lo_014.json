        "title": "Research Internship - Evaluating Interactions with Virtual Characters in Augmented Reality Applications (France)",
        "description": "**Duration of the internship**\\n5 to 6 months\\n\\n**Hours per week**\\n35 hours\\n\\n**Preferred start date**\\nNo preference \\n\\n**Preferred end date**\\nNo preference \\n\\n**Further information about host organisation and relevant links**\\nThe candidate will work in the joined Inria \/ IRISA research centre located in Rennes. Inria (www.inria.fr) and IRISA (http:\/\/www.irisa.fr) are amongst the leading research centres in Computer Sciences in France. The work will be supervised by members of the VirtUs team, internationally recognised in the fields of Computer Graphics, Virtual Human Simulation, and Virtual Reality.  \\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\nInteractions with other persons are ubiquitous in our daily lives, ranging from social interactions in personal and professional situations, to physical interactions, e.g. in sports. For this reason, researchers have striven for years to understand, model, and repliquate humans to include them in digital replicas, with impressive advancements made in topics such as capturing, rendering, animating, etc. Realistic virtual humans are therefore now common in entertainment applications (e.g., movies, videogames), but have also demonstrated their value in other fields such as architecture, trainging, education, etc.  \\n\\n\\nRecently, realistic virtual humans have also started to be more and more used in immersive Virtual Reality applications in order to study human behaviours. Because of the complexity of studying human behaviours in controlled real situations, being able to immerse users in virtual replicas populated with interactive virtual humans provides a novel paradigm to explore such questions. For instance, VR was used to compare pairwise interactions between real and virtual situations [Olivier et al. 2018], to explore when pedestrians choose to go through or around groups of characters [Bruneau et al. 2015], to explore the relation between gaze activity and collision avoidance during pedestrian interactions [Berton et al. 2019, 2020], or to explore exit choices during evacuations [Ríos and Pelechano 2020]. It was even recently used to crowd datasets by immersing only one single user, successively embodying several virtual agents by him\/herself [Yin et al. 2022, 2024]. \\n\\n \\n\\nHowever, immersive VR applications can have limitations in the level of realism and variety of scenarios that can be explored, because of the time and budget constraints required to develop a variety of scenarios. Instead, Augmented Reality could provide an interesting alternative to automatically deploy out-of-the-lab and in-the-wild applications directly in real situations. For instance, one could imagine using Augmented Reality to plan the organization of real events and evaluate the effects of specific arrangements on various crowd-related characteristics (e.g., evacuation, bottlenecks, flows), by automatically populating real places with virtual characters. Nevertheless, including virtual characters in AR applications, in particular involving large virtual crowds, is still challenging. It requires to include them in appropriate locations, depending on the topology of the environment that varies depending on the real scene. This becomes even more difficult when these characters are animated, as they should act according to the environment, and potentially interact with real humans that will be also present. While some attempts have been made at simulating virtual crowds in AR [Akaydın et al. 2013, 2014 ; Hürst and Geraerts 2019], these have only targeted extremely simple setups, and not complex real world situations, or for specific studies (e.g., pedestrian interaction with a virtual car in AR [Maruhn et al. 2020]). Furthermore, it is still unclear whether to which degree interactions with virtual humans in AR differ from interactions in real situations.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe goal of this internship is therefore to explore and evaluate user interactions with virtual characters in AR applications. The first objective will consist in developing an experiment where users will be able to interact with a few animated characters in AR, in particular to evaluate potential differences to existing situations already studied in VR (e.g., dyadic interactions). Then, the second objective will be to explore the potential use of AR to study interactions with larger virtual crowds, which will introduce a number of constraints (in terms of the number of characters that can be animated, their inclusion in the real scene, the semantic of their interactions with the scene, etc.). The experiments and applicationd developed will be based on some of the tools already developed in the Virtus team for crowd simulation, character animation, and immersive virtual crowds, such as CrowdMP and Umans.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThis internship therefore involves :\\n\\n-\\tDeveloping a framework for the animation and simulation of virtual characters in AR \\n\\n-\\tDeveloping a number of simple scenarios of increasing complexity involving user interactions with virtual characters in AR  \\n\\n-\\tEvaluating potential differences in user interactions with virtual characters in AR, in comparison to real or purely virtual situations. \\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Elementary computer skills  \\n- Ability to work in an interdisciplinary team  \\n- Ability to work autonomously  \\n- Ability to analyse and synthesise  \\n- Ability in organising and planning  \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\n- Link on how to find an accomodation in Rennes : https:\/\/cmi.univ-rennes.fr\/en\/housing\\n- Access to sports facilities on campus \\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nWeekly meetings \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\nNone\\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n- Applied science  \/  Engineering and technology \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\n- Master level 1\\n- Master level 2",

Accordingly, their sensorimotor capabilities are essential and largely determine the activities that robots can perform. In recent years, great progress has been made in sensory capabilities (especially in perception), thanks to significant dvances in machine learning (ML) and dedicated ML hardware. In contrast, much less progress has been made in the area of motor skills. In the current state of the art, one of the most promising approaches is Model Predictive Control (MPC), which forms the basis of the control architecture of most advanced dynamic robots.\\n\\nIn MPC, the control actions are optimized over a finite time horizon, considering the time evolution of robot dynamics to optimize a given cost or reward function that describes the robot motion. \\n\\n From a control point of view, the following properties should be fulfilled: (1) taking into account the actual morphology when modelling the dynamics of the robot, (2) a planning horizon that is as long as possible to be able to plan complex sequences and to take contacts with the environment into account and (3) a control frequency that is as high as possible to be able to meet the real-time conditions imposed by real-world physics and, if necessary, to replan the sequence of movements.\\n\\nUsing algorithm-specific hardware acceleration, which exploits the control approach&#039;s algorithmic properties, allows the implementation of safe real-time MPC with long prediction horizons and high control frequencies. However, the structure of the control algorithms is complex, and the algorithms are sensitive to numerical errors or reduced arithmetic precision. Furthermore, failures in the control algorithms can lead to catastrophic failures and unpredictable and possibly dangerous behaviors of the robot. Thus, it is necessary to apply a Hardware-Algorithm-Co-Design approach, i.e., to adapt the currently available control algorithms to the underlying hardware and to design the hardware in such a way that it is optimally suited for the control algorithms.\\n\\nIn the last years, domain-specific hardware acceleration (using GPUs or dedicated hardware) has become increasingly popular [1], [2], [3], [4]. Since GPU acceleration suffers from high power consumption and is not flexible, a recent promising approach is to consider dedicated accelerators, such as FPGAs or Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) [5], [6], [7]. \\n \\nSimilarly to GPU acceleration, FPGA designs for the computational kernels behind MPC, e.g. structured Quadratic Programming (QP) that has to be solved online and repeatedly, have been recently proposed [8]. Depending on the approach, the accelerator has to focus on various low-level linear algebra routines that compose the algorithm, such as matrix-vector multiplies, linear solvers, and matrix factorization.\\n\\nHowever, designing such accelerators is a challenging task, with the resulting architectures being often so specific to a particular problem instance [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], such that it is difficult to reuse them even with a related application within the same domain. Even when a general approach appears, it is usually geared for data center-level applications and does not necessarily translate easily to an embedded accelerator context. Many parallel implementations exist to accelerate MPC [14] as well as studies on accelerating MPC on FPGAs [7], [15], [16], [17]. In the very resource-constrained context of small-scale UAVs, even if FPGA platforms have been used to accelerate many aspects of UAVs, such as path planning, simultaneous localization and mapping, stereo vision, system stability, state estimation, target tracking, communications, obstacle avoidance, and interfacing with peripherals [18], MPC acceleration has not yet been demonstrated. Therefore, dedicated low-power hardware implementations are needed to push forward the limits of MPC algorithms on UAVs [19].\\n\\nEnvisaged Activities: \\nThe proposed MSc internship&#039;s objective is to design HW accelerators for UAV MPC algorithms, with the goal of improving accuracy, performance, power consumption, and silicon area. \\n\\nIn more detail, the candidate will:\\n- Study the state-of-the-art algorithms for UAV to identify HW acceleration opportunities (e.g., parallelization, pipelining).\\n\\n- Implement hardware accelerator(s) for the identified algorithms\\n\\n- Integration in the UAV platform, test, and result analysis\\n\\n- Publication of the results to an international workshop\/conference\\n\\nMost importantly, we seek highly motivated candidates.\\n\\nRelated references: \\n[1] V.
