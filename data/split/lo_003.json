        "description": "#### Learning objectives\\n\\nThe public space of metropolises as well as medium and small-sized towns is profoundly marked by the historic and contemporary traces of linguistic practices, such as graffiti, informal messages, public and commercial signs. These signs are produced by different actors and also carry out different functions. Linguistic Landscape (LL) research investigates the distribution of monolingual and multilingual signs in the public sphere, their linguistic and semiotic features, as well as their functions and evolution over time. In doing so, it aims to provide insights into the status of historic and migration-related minority languages in a specific territory.\\n\\nIn this **web-based training**, students will be introduced to the main theoretical approaches and empirical methods for mapping linguistic diversity in public spaces. Particular attention is dedicated to an overview of the current state of LL research in three EDUC areas, that is, Brandenburg and Berlin, Brno and Czech Republic, Cagliari and Sardinia. \\n\\nAt the end of the web-based training, participants will:\\n* be able to describe the complex present and past sociolinguistic situations in Berlin and Brandenburg, Brno and Prague, Cagliari and Sardinia.\\n* become familiar with the current state of research on LLs in these three areas and develop awareness about the distribution of LL signs in their own territory.\\n* be able to discuss advantages and disadvantages of some theoretical-methodological approaches concerning data collection and analysis in LL.\\n* be able to analyze monolingual and multilingual LL signs, describe their functions and link their features to the status of different minority languages and the language ideologies toward them in a given territory.\\n* be able to evaluate and defend responses to a range of linguistic landscape issues.    \\n\\n",

The traces of the past left by academic or popular culture offer, in their different expressions (literature, poetry, cinema, art, design, cuisine, architecture, etc.), elements of reflection that will be considered in the sessions of this class. \\n\\nThe theoretical foundations come from the major achievements of cultural studies and postcolonial studies which have profoundly changed the analytical approach to criticism (literary, cinematographic, artistic) about Italian postmodernity. By reversing the north-western perspective which often underestimated Italian culture in the 19th and 20th centuries, lots of Italian literary and artistic works, as well as films, have highlighted - to denounce them - the balance of power and epistemological violence that have often relegated the whole Italy in the “South of the world”, a geocultural construction perceived as backward and underestimated.\\n\\n- Wednesday January 19, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Alessandro Benucci, UPN) \\n- Wednesday January 26, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Valeria Deplano, UNICA) \\n- Wednesday February 2, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Giuliana Pias, UPN)\\n- Wednesday February 9, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Alessandro Pes, UNICA)\\n- Wednesday February 16, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Silvia Contarini, UPN)\\n- Wednesday February 23, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Christophe Mileschi, UPN)\\n",

Such an equation provides a description of the infinitesimal increment of the path y in terms of the infinitesimal increment of a driving signal h. Usual ordinary differential equations correspond to h(t) = t, but numerous situations require that we consider non-smooth signal that may not be differentiable, like in stochastic differential equations,where h is a Brownian trajectory. \\nWhat is then the meaning of the above equation? Rough path theory provides an optimal setting for such question, and has applications to controlled deterministic and stochastic systems, noisy PDEs or machine learning! Two thirds of the lectures will deal with the purely analytic side of the story, so the students from the Analysis pathway are most welcome to attend the course. \\n\\n> Live sessions on Zoom:\\nFrom 11\/01\/2022 to 25\/02\/2022 \\n       - Tuesday 16h15-18h15 \\n       - Friday 16h15-18h15 \\n \\n> Replays available on EDUC Moodle:\\nFrom 17\/01\/2022 to 29\/04\/2022\\n  \\n2. \"\"Introduction to Toric Geometry\"\" by Carl Tipler (Rennes 1 University)\\n\\nIn this class, we will study complex varieties endoxed with a complex (multiplicative) torus action, with a dense and open torus orbit. We will give the combinatorial description of these varieties in terms of fans. This will provide a link between algebraic geometry and convex geometry. We will then describe some of the properties of these varieties, such as completeness and smoothness, in terms of their fans. We will apply these descriptions in dimension two, give the classification of complete smooth toric surfaces and study toric surface singularities and their resolutions.\\n\\n> Live sessions on Zoom:\\nFrom 11\/01\/2022 to 02\/02\/2022   \\n       - Tuesday 14h-17h \\n       - Wednesday 8h-11h \\n\\n> Replays available on EDUC Moodle:\\nFrom 17\/01\/2022 to 29\/04\/2022\\n\\n3.\"\"Computational Topology\"\" by Myfanwy Evans (University of Potsdam)\\n\\nBased on “Computational Topology: An Introduction\"\", by Herbert Edelsbrunner and John Harer.\\nThis course will give an introduction to the field of computational topology. It will start with motivating problems in both mathematics and computer science followed by classic topics in geometric and algebraic topology, and ending with the concept of persistent homology. The course provides an introduction to a topic which transforms a mostly theoretical field of mathematics into one that is relevant to a multitude of disciplines in the sciences and engineering. The course will be based on the book: H. Edelsbrunner and J. Harer. Computational Topology. An Introduction. Amer. Math. Soc. 2010. \\n\\n> Starting date : mid-April \\n> Duration : 6 weeks\\n> Replays available on EDUC Moodle\\n\\n4. \"\"An introduction to Gibbs measures in Statistical Mechanics\"\" by Sylvie Roelly (University of Potsdam)\\n\\nInspired by the book from Friedli and Velenik, we aim to present a mathematical introduction to Gibbsian lattice systems. We first focus on some of the most important and relevant examples,  the Ising model, and introduce in that framework the concepts of magnetization, infinite volume system (or thermodynamic limit), phase transition versus uniqueness etc. Several methods (e.g. contour arguments, cluster expansion, regularity of the pressure) will be used to prove the main results.\\n\\n> Starting date : mid-April \\n> Duration : 6 weeks\\n> Replays available on EDUC Moodle",

In input lectures, the media-technological and media-legal conditions for this are expounded, analytical methods opinion influencing and results of analyses already carried out are presented as well as possibilities of debunking and counter acting. In the workshops, the students jointly take a look at platforms and social media through which fake news and conspiracy myths on various topics are spread. In doing so, they apply the analytical models presented. The results of their micro-studies provide an insight into the current dynamics of shifts in the perception and evaluation of social events and images of reality on a European level.\\n\\nlearning objectives: Theoretical basics (interdisciplinary), models of culturalsemiotic analysis for meaning building and their practical application for analysis\\n\\n#### Section 2: Details of the learning scenario\\nThis learning offer is an on site summer school at the University of Potsdam\\nPlease consider a work-load per week of: 40 hours\\n\\n\\n#### Section 3: Schedule\/Timetable of the learning offer\\nStarting: 11\/07\/2022\\nEnd: 22\/07\/2022\\nEvaluation period: final presentations on July 22, 2022\\nMo-Fr: 9:00 - 16:30",

        "description": "As the scientific consensus on climate change and its anthropogenic causes is settled, there is an increasing shift of focus towards the ways climatic risks are received by people and institutions and towards the policies that can respond to these risks. These two areas are at the core of this years’ EDUC summer school: climate change communication and climate policies.\\n\\nDuring the course, students will learn about the key factors in climate change communication and understand the obstacles that stand in the way of reaching a societal consensus on the risks of climate change and on the policies needed to slow it down. The course will provide students with experience and practical advice regarding climate change communication and advocacy and give them the opportunity to work on climate communication alongside experts. We will focus on effective tools of communication, including the study of narratives in political conflict, the dynamics of public opinion and the role of marketing and labelling approaches. Students will have the opportunity to design their own climate change campaign in teams and consult it with experts.\\n\\nThe focus on policy will include an introduction to the range of climate-related public policies, starting from transnational measures and going all the way to local adaptations and regulations. The students will learn the complex aspects of climate policymaking on the local level and the various strategies that can be used to foster climatic resilience of cities. The teaching will be supplemented by academic site visits and field trips where students can observe the measures in practice and discuss them with experts. In their final project, students will propose policy designs and simulate their implementation as a part of participatory research.",

The climate is changing in every region of the earth, rapidly and with increasingly frequent extreme events. Climate experts have long since moved away from the term &#039;climate crisis&#039; to the more alarmist &#039;climate emergency&#039;. In this context, the International Smart City School (ISCiS) 2022 edition aims to promote the development of cities to make them smart, sustainable, and resilient through the most suitable technologies and according to a strategic and systemic vision. In-depth understanding of how a smart city approach could contribute to find solutions to mitigate and adapt to the climate change\\n\\nCourse structure:\\nLectures (28 hours) will go through four main points of view:\\n- imagination (strategic level)\\n- planning (design level)\\n- governance (policy level)\\n- and tools (technical level).\\nThe course is characterized by an interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder approach, providing participants with the technical tools and operational skills to translate the concepts learnt into concrete solutions thanks to an integrated approach with lectures, practical case illustrations and co-working laboratories.\\n\\nCo-working laboratories (25 hours), are conceived as moments of interdisciplinary design and planning between participants and experts and will be organized dividing participants in teams of 5\/6 students giving them the possibility to use a web GIS tool.\\n\\nMain features:\\nLecturers from EDUC partner universities: Jürgen P. Kropp, University of Potsdam, Institute for Climate Impact Research. Other contributions possible.\\nStudy visits: CRS4 (Sardinian interdisciplinary research center with a smart control room), Sotacarbo (Sustainable Energy Research Center).\\nNetworking events called “AperiNet” where enterprises and start-ups will present their smart solutions to face climate change.\\nSide events: to discover Sardinian culture and traditions (Cagliari city tour, Nora ancient city, etc.).\\n\\nTimeframe: 19th June – 1st July 2022\\n\\n",

Built on an action-orientated approach and a fully Moodle-based online learning material, it addresses reception, production, interaction and mediation in terms of language activities in connection to language strategies in various, but typical areas of communication related to academic life in Potsdam. Consequently, it does neither claim to “cover” the whole level A1 according to the CEFR nor to provide A1 exam training but instead to empower successful participants to take their first steps in a German speaking surrounding and – equally important – to manage their further language acquisition.\\n\\nUpon successfully engaging in this course, learners:\\n- can recognise concrete information (e.g. places and times) on familiar topics encountered in everyday life, provided it is delivered slowly and clearly.\\n- can understand some expressions when people are discussing them: personal and academic life, hobbies or surroundings, provided the delivery is slow and clear.\\n- can understand instructions addressed carefully and slowly to them and follow short, simple directions.\\n- can understand very short, simple texts a single phrase at a time, picking up familiar names, words and basic phrases.\\n- can guess the probable meaning of an unknown word\/sign that is similar to one in the language they normally use.\\n- can produce simple, mainly isolated phrases about people, time and places.\\n- can ask and answer simple questions, initiate and respond to simple statements in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.\\n- can make an introduction and use basic greeting and leave-taking expressions.\\n- can ask for food and drink using basic expressions.\\n- can handle numbers, quantities, cost and time (can-do statements according to the CEFR).\\n\\nSection 2: Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nMode: Hybrid – participation in classroom or online via Zoom and Moodle\\n\\nSection 3: Schedule\/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nStarting: 21\/04\/2022\\nEnd: 28\/07\/2022\\nEvaluation period: from TBD\\nLive sessions:\\nThursdays: 16:15 - 19:30 h\\n",
