The training is divided into weekly sequences based on resources and activities organised on the following topics : \\n\\nWeek 1: PhD and Career Development - an overview \\nWeek 2: Skills &amp; Competencies \\nWeek 3: Career paths and your Professional Development Plan Association PhDOOC - Contact : phdooc@gmail.com MOOC : http:\/\/phdooc.moocit.fr \\nWeek 4: Networking \\nWeek 5: Applying for a job (even unsolicited ones!) \\nWeek 6: Extra time to complete the training \\nAn optional unit with resources and activities on the topic of entrepreneurship, the academic career path, and social innovation is included. \\n\\nEach sequence includes various resources and individual and collaborative activities. Experts will also give webinars on each of the weekly topics. Exchanges between participants are encouraged via thematic discussion threads. The sequences remain open and the resources accessible online after the animation time. Additional time at the end of the training course may allow participants to complete their training. This way, everyone can follow the course at their own pace. \\n\\nStarting this year, all the contents and activities are proposed in French and English, to allow the greatest number of participants to take and complete this MOOC successfully. Also, an optional unit has been created that contains resources and activities built in partnership with experts in entrepreneurship, social innovation and academic careers, to allow participants to explore other potential career paths open to PhDs.\\n\\nValidation and duration of this training \\n\\nThe &quot;PhD and Career Development&quot; MOOC is an online, free and open training (MOOC stands for Massive Open Online Course). The MOOC offers two learning pathways spread over 6 weeks : \\n\\n- The &quot;basic&quot; learning pathways requires approximately 2 hours of work per week (i.e. 12 hours of training). This pathway is validated upon completion of quizzes and collaborative activities. \\n\\n- The &quot;advanced&quot; learning pathway requires roughly 4 hours per week. In addition to the quizzes and collaborative activities required for the basic learning pathway, the participant must complete two peer reviewed activities and participate in complementary collaborative activities to validate this pathway. \\n\\nParticipants can obtain a certificate for their chosen course, subject to successful completion. Two types of certificate will be issued: &quot;common course&quot; and &quot;advanced course&quot;.

        "description": "The half-day study session has an introductory function, demonstrating the value to researchers of critical and problematic reflection on research ethics and scientific integrity. Its aim is to raise doctoral students&#039; awareness by outlining the main issues and concepts.\\n\\nDescription\\nMorning programme:\\n- Introduction to research ethics and scientific integrity led by Mathieu Rouault, Grand Labo science journalist.\\n- Lecture on legal and moral ethics by Jean-Marcel PIRIOU, research engineer at the CNRM (Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques), CNRS \/ Météo-France.\\nHe provides training in ‘ethics and scientific integrity’ for doctoral students at the Toulouse Doctoral School. In 2012, he published the book ‘Happiness here and now’, which looks at the link between ethics, law and morality, and other notions of general philosophy. The lecture will be followed by a 30-minute discussion.\\nPresentation\\nIn the first part, he will give examples of ethical, societal or research problems (debates on animal experimentation, localisation and 5G, plagiarism in research, tensions over co-authorship or the anteriority of results, the societal role of whistleblowers, etc.). He will then document the links and differences between ethics, law and morality: definitions, examples. He will discuss their causal links, and how ethical reflection drives the development of laws and morals. It will look at ethics in history. And he will give examples of ethical dilemmas in research, which will be an opportunity to present a central method in ethical reflection: identifying the values at stake, then sorting them out, and stressing the importance of an open and consensual debate on them (ethics committees). He will use examples to illustrate the link between values and virtues. He will also review scientific truth and its link with the ethical approach. He will define scientific ethics and integrity, and give examples. The final session will focus on the link between ethics and self-confidence, and how the ethical approach is liberating.\\n- Round table: Ethics and scientific integrity officer in higher education establishments: role and missions\\nThe issues of scientific ethics and integrity are becoming increasingly important in the conduct of research, as well as in the publication of research results and the promotion of research. This concern must therefore emerge right from the research training that constitutes doctoral studies. In addition to the major ethical principles that prohibit plagiarism and the publication of fraudulent results, ethical issues arise throughout the research process, in the day-to-day work of the researcher, with the collection and use of data. This varies from one scientific discipline to another, but they are all involved in one way or another: protection of individuals, protection of digital data, animal rights and environmental protection, etc. In addition to the vigilance that researchers must maintain in their practice, they may also need to obtain authorisations from bodies dedicated to these aspects, which will be discussed in the course of this half-day training session.",

In addition, stricter regulations and the challenges of social responsibility mean that the fundamental principles of scientific integrity must be understood and embraced.\\nFrance&#039;s various research organizations have stepped up their initiatives, and their convergence led to the signing of the Charter of Ethics for Research Professions by France Universités (Association of Universities and Higher Education and Research Establishments) and the main organizations in January 2015. Following the report submitted by Prof. Pierre Corvol in 2016, &quot;Bilan et propositions de mise en œuvre de la charte nationale d&#039;intégrité scientifique&quot;, several decisions were taken, including :\\n\\n- doctoral schools must ensure that doctoral students receive training in ethics and scientific integrity,\\n- establishments have appointed a scientific integrity referent,\\n- a French Office of Scientific Integrity (OFIS) was set up in 2017 within the Haut Conseil de l&#039;évaluation de la recherche et de l&#039;enseignement supérieur (Hcéres). \\n\\nThis mobilization was reinforced at the end of 2021 by the publication of a legislative decree on compliance with scientific integrity requirements by public establishments and foundations contributing to the public research service. This text introduces into the law a definition of scientific integrity and the obligation for establishments to ensure the awareness and training of their staff and students in respecting the requirements of scientific integrity.\\n\\nCommitted to this issue since 2012 with the adoption of a charter, the University of Bordeaux has, in partnership with the CPU, COMETS-CNRS, INSERM and INRA, developed the training course on scientific integrity that we are offering you.",

Since 2020, it has brought together about 300  B.A. English and B.Ed. English students from the University of Potsdam and Beit Berl College (Israel) and provides these students with opportunities to experience virtual collaboration. The course instructors in Germany and Israel (originally from the USA, South Africa, and Great Britain) focus on improving students’ oral proficiency in English (accuracy, fluency, pronunciation), and participants have been able to attain a high proficiency in the main communicative language competences as outlined in the CEFR.\\nWhat is more, INTERFACE presents a form of didactic modeling, which is especially important for future educators. Student participants are encouraged to take an active role in this online project and thus have have a degree of autonomy (cf. UP Mission Statement for Teaching and Learning, “4. Target group-specific teaching”). They can select which digital tools work best for them, reflect on alternative assessment models (tasks and rubrics), and decide what constitutes authentic learning and a safe online learning environment. In doing so, they grow to understand the importance of collaboration and innovation. By working in English with speakers of Arabic, Hebrew, German, and other languages, the students question their ideas of the “Other” and grow to embrace diversity.  Furthermore, the project also prepares the students with skills for life and the workforce, such as flexibility and adaptability, social and cross-cultural skills, and accountability and responsibility (cf. UP Mission Statement for Teaching and Learning, “2. Career orientation and personal development”). \\n**We welcome students in the EDUC alliance to participate in some of the sessions (for no ECTS points) or for all of the sessions (for an EDUC certificate stating 90 hours as workload, equivalent to 3 ECTS).** In both cases, students will be issued an EDUC certificate. **Passive participants will be removed from the Moodle course.** \\nPlease see &quot;More Info&quot; for the course time, expected outcomes, and requirements.",

However, they find it harder to get a job, are more likely to find themselves in precarious situations, are often paid less and have fewer opportunities for promotion, including in academia. For example, the salary of a male manager is five times higher than it was at the start of his career, while that of a female manager is only 2.7 times higher (INSEE 2010). This situation can be explained by a number of factors: the burden of domestic tasks and bringing up children, lower professional ambitions, male solidarity, less assertiveness, dedication to the company without sufficient recognition of the work done, etc.\\n\\nThe aims of this course are to:\\n\\n- Help doctoral students identify the various factors that can limit their ability\\n\\n- Advance and to give them the means to avoid having to put up with a situation.\\n\\n- Examine the impact of male domination at university and how it relates to other forms of discrimination.\\n\\n- Learn about policies to promote gender equality at university and their possible limitations.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nObjectives\\n\\nThe aim of this module is to acquire the following skills:\\n\\n- Identify the different types of harassment: moral harassment, sexual harassment, discriminatory harassment, and the forms they can take in higher education and research,\\n\\n- Understand how harassment works, the effects on the victims and the strategies of the perpetrators,\\n\\n- Be familiar with the legal and regulatory texts governing these issues, in particular the obligations of higher education and research establishments, and know how to use them,\\n\\n- Be familiar with the various avenues of recourse: non-contentious or contentious (disciplinary or criminal),\\n\\n- Know how to react to a situation of harassment and identify the roles of possible contacts, both internal and external.\\n\\n\\n\\nPROGRAMME :\\n\\n-  Introductory quiz,\\n-  Post-it workshop: harassment and its effects (based on trainees&#039; experiences),\\n-  Identifying harassment (moral, discriminatory, sexual): legal and sociological framework \\n-  Knowing how to prevent and react: the establishment&#039;s obligations (prevention \/ support \/ treatment), avenues of appeal, places and resource persons in Brittany,\\n-  How to react as an active witness and prevent harassment: workshop with role play,\\n-  Conclusion and evaluation\\n\\n\\n\\n",
