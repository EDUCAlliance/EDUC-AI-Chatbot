        "description": "**Duration of the internship**\\n6 months\\n\\n**Hours per week**\\n35 hours\\n\\n**Preferred start date**\\nAs soon as possible \\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\nThe goal of this Master Thesis is the design and validation of novel aerial platforms for Aerial Physical Interaction and collaborative transportation.\\n\\nDescription: \\nAerial Physical Interaction (APhI) is a promising and challenging topic which raised the interest of academia and industry. The ability of interacting with the environment, together with the motion capabilities of drones, makes these platforms much more than aerial robots. Moreover, when multiple robots collaborate with each other, the redundancy of the group can be exploited to perform collaborative transportation in an agile way with a significant payload.\\n\\nMotivations: Most of the existing Aerial Physical Interaction  platforms were not designed from the beginning with end effectors to interact with the environment. Tools such as rigid sticks, serial or parallel robotic arms are added afterward to the aerial robot.  The tasks that such robots are able to perform, however, are much more complex than single drones not in interaction with the environment. A new design which takes into account from the beginning the tool(s) for physical interaction is therefore necessary to improve and optimize the performance from mechanical, electronic and energetic points of view. Moreover, also drones used for collaborative transportation are not designed and optimized for that task. A novel design with the final application in mind will improve them and drastically reduce their limitations.\\n\\nGeneral Objectives: The goal of this Master Thesis is the design and validation of novel aerial platforms for Aerial Physical Interaction and collaborative transportation. In particular, a new hexarotor with a robotic arm will be designed, optimizing both the mechanics and the onboard electronics, taking inspiration from the TiltHex platform already available in our team; a novel design of the robotic arm could also be considered, while for the moment we integrate a leg of the SOLO12 quadruped robot as an arm attached to the drone (see GitHub link below). Finally, a new design for the quadcopters used in the FlyCrane platform will be performed, considering the final task of cooperative transportation to optimize mechanical and electrical aspects.\\n\\nAvailable equipment :\\nWe have two drone arenas equipped with motion capture systems, used to fly several types of drones, from small Crazyflies to hexarotors (see images). A lab space with tools, soldering stations and 3D printers is also available. For static experiments, a robot room with several serial robotic arms is also available.\\n\\nEnvisaged Activities: \\nThe student will be introduced in the Rainbow Team and will work in collaboration with PhD students and research engineers.\\n\\n1. At first, the student will become familiar with the relevant literature on this subject (some references are listed below), with the software tools and with the platforms available in the team.\\n\\n2. Then, the student will take over the existing works and start designing and prototyping novel platforms.\\n\\n3. Finally, when promising prototypes will be obtained and tested in simulation, the student will validate them with real flights in the drone arenas\\n\\nRelated references: \\n- A. Ollero, M.

The physical interactions between UAVs, load and cables render collaborative manipulation a challenging task from both a planning and control perspective. Existing solutions require either quasi-static assumptions that limit the dynamic behaviour of the system, which limits their operational speeds; or neglect safety-related constraints such as cable tautness and non-collisions between UAVs. Therefore, this project envisions developing the next generation of multi-UAV systems to achieve fast, safe, and robust manipulation of a cable-suspended load in the real world. \\nIn this project, the student will collaborate with researchers from the University of Twente and the University of Catania, to develop and experimentally validate a novel theory based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and adaptive control.\\n\\nList of 5 bibliographical references:\\n\\n- Sun, S., &amp; Franchi, A.

Aerial manipulators are aerial robots (e.g., quadcopters) equipped with tools (e.g., robotic arms) able to interact with the environment, thus enhancing the capabilities of the robot and widening the possible tasks which can be performed. These inherently unstable and complex systems come with challenging design and control problems.\\n\\nPrevious designs of aerial manipulators [2] did not allow to control each actuator at the force\/torque level, thus leading to slow and inaccurate tasks. The proposed Master Thesis faces this issue by designing and implementing a full-body control which considers both the dynamics of the aerial robot and the manipulator and leverages state of the art techniques such as QP-based control and MPC [4]. In particular, a new torque-controlled arm is to be designed and implemented for the tilt-hex hexacopter platform [5] (available in the Rainbow Team), in order to obtain a thrust-torque  (optimal) control for the robot.\\n\\nThe designed control system will be tested in the drone arena of the Rainbow Team, and the experimental results will be compared to the results of previous works in the aerial manipulation literature.\\n\\nList of 5 bibliographical references:\\n\\n- A.

        "description": "**Duration of the internship**\\n2 months\\n\\n**Hours per week**\\n35 hours\\n\\n**Preferred start date**\\nMay 2025 \\n\\n**Further information about host organisation and relevant links**\\n\\nhttps:\/\/iscr.univ-rennes.fr\/\\n\\nhttps:\/\/iscr.univ-rennes.fr\/natural-products-and-molecules-life-sciences\\n\\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\nKEY WORDS\\nGut-microbiota-brain axis, Redox signalling pathway, Microbial fuel cells, Polyphenols, Antioxidants, Electrochemistry, Metabolomics\\n\\nSUBJECT\\nThe discovery of bacteria&#039;s ability to transport electrons outside their cells has opened up a new field of research, both fundamental and applied, in areas such as the bioremediation of pollutants and the manufacture of biopiles1. One widely recognized model is the microbial fuel cell (MFC). Bacterial electroactivity involves cellular respiration using extracellular solids as electron donors or acceptors. \\nThis phenomenon, discovered in various ecological niches, is a growing interest in research towards the human microbiota, whose severe imbalance, known as dysbiosis, is often observed in many pathologies. Few explored until now, recent studies have shown that some bacteria in the intestinal microbiota are electroactive and capable of extracellular electron transfer2. \\n In this context, our project focuses on three intestinal bacterial strains, Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus reuteri. A. muciniphila, considered as a new-generation probiotic, is a strict anaerobic Gram-negative mucin-degrading bacterium, present at 3-5% in healthy microbiota. Its abundance in the human intestinal tract is drastically reduced under particular metabolic pathological conditions (obesity, type II diabetes...)3. On the contrary, its abundance increases in neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis4. Its high proliferation occurs at the expense of intestinal bacteria belonging, for example, to the genus Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, beneficial in a balanced microbiota. \\nIn previous work, we have demonstrated that Lactobacillus reuteri displays a redox step in the biotransformation of a dietary polyphenol, the 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid5. By the use of electrochemical tools, we have focused on the study of the electroactivity of Lactobacillus reuteri, and the setting of its MFC has confirmed its ability to exchange electrons with the extracellular environment. In sight, we intend to use non-targeted LC-HRMS² analysis to identify metabolites produced during redox activities by the bacteria in MFC. Screening of bacterial metabolites may also enable us to determine whether the electroactivity of certain bacteria is involved in metabolic pathways involved in the gut-brain axis, such as kynurenine or serotonin pathways and biotransformation of polyphenols.\\n\\nTASKS\\nMain activities: The candidate will be responsible for culturing several strains characteristic of the intestinal microbiota (including Lactobacillus reuteri, Bifidobacterium longum and Akkermansia muciniphila), setting up bacterial biopiles and measuring their electroactivity. He\/she will draw up extraction protocols for the metabolites produced in the bacterial environment. \\nMinor activities: He\/she will also participate in the characterisation of extracted metabolites by LC-HRMS\/MS and GC-MS \\n\\nReferences \\n\\n(1) Kumar A., Hsu H.-H., Kavanagh P., Barrière F., Lens P.
