But was the situation so simple? Who were these “barbarians”? And did the Empire really collapse or was it rather transformed? The goal of this course is to focus on the artistic, visual, material, and performative cultures that coexisted in this extraordinary moment of history. To reach this objective, we will firstly focus on the prejudices constructed from the Renaissance to our days about what was commonly considered as the “Dark Ages”. Secondly, we will be investigating the role of medias in the transformations of visual history: from sculptures to “bidimensional” images, from roll to codex, from the illusive image to the iconic one. Third, we will analyze the role played by the meeting of cultures – constitutive for the investigated period – in the birth of the “Middle Ages”.\\n\\nThis course is taught by the Department of Art History at Masaryk University. \\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n- be able to orientate himself in the visual and material cultures of the Late Antique to Early Medieval world;\\n- understand the tools and the importance of visual culture within social and historical phenomena;\\n- fall in love with art history!\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is **asynchronous**, which means that this is an e-learning course (e-learning materials + final essay).\\n\\nPlease consider a workload per the whole course of 125 hours (25 hours\/1 ECTS).",

Extending the invitation to partake in the workshop to the language centers and students of the EDUC partner universities of the University of Potsdam, Zessko and CLE offer a three-session COIL in which students will get the chance to explore their own definition of culture, reflect on their own language and cultural background, practice communicating in English, and become acquainted with the new cultures and stories from their fellow participants. These themes will be mediated in story-telling and predominantly oral activities. In this virtual learning setting, students enhance their language proficiency in English as well as their intercultural communicative competence and are asked 1) to  embrace the opportunities that come with experiencing cultural diversity and 2) to then answer the overarching core question of this workshop about one’s own cultural identity; 3) to respect individual difference and shared global values, and 4) to ultimately rise to the EDUC’s mission statement of creating an inclusive and diverse digital space for intercultural exchange and discourse.\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is **virtual**, and **synchronous**.\\n\\nPlease consider a total work-load of: 4.5 hours (participation EDUC Certificate)\\n\\n#### Schedule\/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nNumber of hours: **1.5 h per session**\\n\\nSessions on: 06\/11\/2023, 20\/11\/202320 and 04\/12\/2023\\n\\n|      Time     \\t| Mo \\t| Tu \\t| We \\t| Th \\t| Fr \\t|\\n|:-------------:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|\\n| 10:00 - 11:30 \\t|  x  \\t|   \\t|    \\t|    \\t|    \\t|\\n\\n",

        "description": "#### Learning objectives\\nINTERFACE (INTERculural proFiciency and orAl Competence in English) is a model project of social online teaching and learning. Since 2020, it has brought together about 300  B.A. English and B.Ed. English students from the University of Potsdam and Beit Berl College (Israel) and provides these students with opportunities to experience virtual collaboration. The course instructors in Germany and Israel (originally from the USA, South Africa, and Great Britain) focus on improving students’ oral proficiency in English (accuracy, fluency, pronunciation), and participants have been able to attain a high proficiency in the main communicative language competences as outlined in the CEFR.\\nWhat is more, INTERFACE presents a form of didactic modeling, which is especially important for future educators. Student participants are encouraged to take an active role in this online project and thus have have a degree of autonomy  (cf. UP Mission Statement for Teaching and Learning, “4. Target group-specific teaching”). They can select which digital tools work best for them, reflect on alternative assessment models (tasks and rubrics), and decide what constitutes authentic learning and a safe online learning environment. In doing so, they grow to understand the importance of collaboration and innovation. By working in English with speakers of Arabic, Hebrew, German, and other languages, the students question their ideas of the “Other” and grow to embrace diversity.  Furthermore, the project also prepares the students with skills for life and the workforce, such as flexibility and adaptability, social and cross-cultural skills, and accountability and responsibility (cf. UP Mission Statement for Teaching and Learning, “2. Career orientation and personal development”). \\n**We welcome students in the EDUC alliance to participate in some of the sessions (for no ECTS points) or for all of the sessions (an EDUC certificate stating 90 hours as workload, equivalent to 3 ECTS).** In both cases, students will be issued an EDUC certificate. **Passive participants will be removed from the Moodle course.** \\n\\nUpon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:\\n\\n- recognize and practice appropriate articulation of English phonemes\\n- raise awareness of and practise the suprasegmental features of English, including stress and intonation patterns, as well as connected speech\\n- learn how to identify interference from one’s native language and develop skills for speaking intelligibly\\n- recognize and comprehend a variety of accents to navigate different communicative contexts\\n- discuss relevant topics with the goal of engaging in meaningful discourse in different contexts (e.g. presentations and interviews)\\n- gain insight into the interconnection between pronunciation and non-verbal behaviour in conveying and interpreting meaning, particularly when giving academic presentations.\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is **synchronous**\\n\\n#### Schedule\/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nStarting: 16\/10\/2023\\nEnd: 09\/02\/2024\\nTuesdays from 14:00 to 16:00 h\\n\\n|      Time     \\t| Mo \\t| Tu \\t| We \\t| Th \\t| Fr \\t|\\n|:-------------:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|\\n| 14:00 - 16:00|    \\t|  x \\t|    \\t|    \\t|    \\t|\\n",

Consequently, it does neither claim to “cover” the whole level A1 according to the CEFR nor to provide A1 exam training but instead to empower successful participants to take their first steps in a German speaking surrounding and – equally important – to manage their further language acquisition.\\n\\nUpon successfully engaging in this course, learners:\\n- can recognise concrete information (e.g. places and times) on familiar topics encountered in everyday life, provided it is delivered slowly and clearly.\\n- can understand some expressions when people are discussing them: personal and academic life, hobbies or surroundings, provided the delivery is slow and clear.\\n- can understand instructions addressed carefully and slowly to them and follow short, simple directions.\\n- can understand very short, simple texts a single phrase at a time, picking up familiar names, words and basic phrases.\\n- can guess the probable meaning of an unknown word\/sign that is similar to one in the language they normally use.\\n- can produce simple, mainly isolated phrases about people, time and places.\\n- can ask and answer simple questions, initiate and respond to simple statements in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.\\n- can make an introduction and use basic greeting and leave-taking expressions.\\n- can ask for food and drink using basic expressions.\\n- can handle numbers, quantities, cost and time (can-do statements according to the CEFR).\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nMode: Flipped classroom with asynchronous individual learning through Moodle (instruction, exercises and quizzes, assignments) + regular video meetings via Zoom (collaborative task-based learning) according to participants’ progress with the individual learning (admission to meetings may be linked to the assignments).\\n\\n**Workload: 180 h (*equivalent to 6 ECTS)**\\n\\n#### Schedule\/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nStarting: 19\/10\/2023\\nEnd: 09\/02\/2024\\nExam: most likely 8th February 2024\\nLive sessions:\\n**Thursdays: 16:00 - 19:30 h, weekly**\\n",

        "description": " \\n#### Learning objectives\\n\\nThe Seminar will deal with questions of the inter-relation of the spatial category of islands with intellectual phenomena linked to the Enlightenment with regard to different dimensions:\\n- Island Literatures of the 18th Century and beyond: the Early Modern Genre of Island Utopias is continued and transformed in the 18th Century and forms a wide-spread genre in the different European contexts (beginning with Daniel Defoe’s “Robinson Crusoe” and its European reception in works such as J.G. Schnabels “Insel Felsenburg” leading to Denis Diderots “Supplement au voyage de Bougainville” in France or Wilhelm Heinses “Glückselige Inseln” in Germany). Connected to this are crucial discourses of the Enlightenment on social and economic reforms, questions of colonialism and Euro-centrism etc.\\n- Political significance of Islands and the Haitian Revolution: in the (colonial) system of World Powers islands played a crucial role. The Haitian Revolution of 1790ff. is the major event which inspired questions on the relation of Enlightenment and colonialism until today.\\n- In the philosophical discourses of the Enlightenment the “island” understood in a broader metaphorical sense is a central motive on different levels (epistemology, political philosophy, social philosophy, economy etc.) These are ranging from indigene cartographies from the Pacifics up to the methodological individualism in Adam Smith’ “The Wealth of Nations”.\\nThe aim of the Summer School is to bring together the various research clusters at the EDUC partner universities. At least at the universities of Potsdam, Cagliari, and Paris Nanterre there are existing internationally visible research foci related to the topic which promise fruitful synergies and we invite further EDUC partner universities to participate.\\n\\nThree main topics have been defined so far:\\n1. Island Literatures\\nThe participants will learn about European literatures of the 18th Century and the crucial position of islands for the development of Enlightenment&#039;s genres (from Daniel Defoe&#039;s Robinson Crusoe on).\\n\\n2. Island Epistemologies\\nThe participants will learn to reflect the role of islands (as a topographical concept as well as in a metaphorical sense) for epistemological models of the Enlightenment (from Bacon&#039;s Nova Atlantis to Adam Smith&#039;s methodological individualism)\\n\\n3. Island Politics: The participants will learn about the role of Islands in the colonial system of the 18th Century and their significance as contact zone of European and extra-European cultures in the development of key concepts of the Enlightenment (like in Diderot&#039;s writings on Tahiti or in the Haitian Enlightenment)\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario:\\n\\nThis learning offer is a blended research summer school, which means eight weeks of online learning with one live session per week plus one week of on site-program at the university of Potsdam.\\n\\nPlease consider a total workload of: 90 hours.\\n\\nThe minimum technical requirements you need to participate are: e.g.: Zoom account.\\n\\n#### Schedule\/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\n##### Virtual phase:\\n- Starting: 6 May 2024\\n- End: 24 June 2024\\n- One online session per week (Mondays from 4-6 p.m)*\\n\\n|      Time     \\t| Mo \\t| Tu \\t| We \\t| Th \\t| Fr \\t|\\n|:-------------:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|\\n| 16:00 - 18:00 \\t|   X\\t|   \\t|    \\t|    \\t|    \\t|\\n\\n##### On site-week\\n- Dates: From 1 to 5 July, 2024\\n- Schedule: Mo-Fr: 10:00-18:00\\n[🗎 First draft of on site-program](https:\/\/www.uni-potsdam.de\/fileadmin\/projects\/educ\/F%C3%BCr_Studierende\/Summer_Schools\/EDUC_blended_research_summer_school_Islands_of_the_Enlightenment_preliminary_programme_U_Potsdam.pdf)\\n\\n#### Application &amp; Scholarships:\\nStudents in this program receive an EDUC scholarship from their home university to finance their participation in the on site week.
