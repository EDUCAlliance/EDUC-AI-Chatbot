It asks how these places are often simultaneously understood and imagined as Indigenous Country, as the site of colonisation and settler homemaking, or as locations of a modern multicultural nation. The process of narration plays an important role in such understandings and imaginings of places and we will focus on how and why such narratives (in the broadest sense) are constructed and what forms they might take. Starting out from an engagement with the Aboriginal Australian concept of ‘Country’, we will focus on iconic Australian locations such as the outback, the beach, the city, or the border and ask how they are narrated across a range of cultural productions including literature, film and the visual arts.",

        "description": "Section 1: Learning objectives\\n\\nThis intensive blended course delves into the global history of processes of refuge-seeking: it explores the many challenges that refugees and migrants face and the opportunities they create in receiving countries. It engages the manifold ways in which citizens have responded to migrants and refugees over time – from the Huguenots’ arrival in Brandenburg-Prussia in 1685 to the present – and in various places, including France, Australia, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Germany. The course also examines the responses and visions of migrants and refugees themselves.\\n\\nThe course brings together 30 students from six European universities through the European Digital UniverCity alliance (EDUC), for ten weeks of online learning (starting on April 19, 2022) followed by a week together in Potsdam June 20-25, 2022. In Potsdam students will meet with local decision-makers, civil society and church representatives, and migrants and refugees to learn first-hand about practices and issues relating to migration and integration.\\n\\nTo prepare for this, students will be introduced to theories around integration and will then engage with historic and contemporary case studies that highlight particular issues such as culture, religion, racism, education, and labour in relation to assimilationism and multiculturalism.\\n\\nOverall, the aim of this course is to provide students with the theoretical and conceptual language to make sense of historical processes of refuge-seeking and integration as well as enabling a lively exchange between student perspectives and practitioners’ insights on processes of integration in the city of Potsdam.\\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n- develop an understanding of integration \/ multiculutralism \/ assimilation\\n- develop an understading of historic roots of present-day integration challenges\\n- realize the global scale of integration measures\\n- reflect on interconnections between refugee and migration integration\\n- develop critical reading and reflection skills\\n-develop analysis of primary and secondary sources skills\\n- develop teamwork skills\\n-develop oral and written presentation skills\\n- develop intercultural skills\\n-develop transfer skills from historic case studies to present circumstances\\n\\nSection 2: Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is a “blended” one, which means that it is divided in two phases: an Online Program from April 19th to June 14th, 2022 consisting of one lesson every Tuesday from 16:00 to 18:00 h.

        "description": "Section 1: Learning objectives\\n\\nThis course harvests the potentials of cross-border online learning, by enabling an exchange of knowledge, ideas and debates that is vital to the historic study of refugees, both historically and in the present. Through this course, students will gain in-depth knowledge about the history of refuge-seeking in Global History. In several historical case studies students will work together using primary and secondary sources thereby gaining an advanced understanding of processes of refuge-seeking in Global History. Located at the southern tip of the European continent on Sardinia, Italy, the students and lecturers of the University of Cagliari bring a unique understanding and perspective not only to historical debates about refuge- seeking, but also to their contemporary relevance. Joining in with students and lecturers from the University of Potsdam, in Brandenburg, Germany, the aim of this course is to enable a lively exchange of student perspectives, informed by the differences and similarities in our experiences, that enriches the learning outcomes of the participating students in ways that would not otherwise have been possible.\\n\\nAt the end of the course, participants will:\\n- have a better understanding of refuge seeking in historic dimension\\n- will have learned to solve historic case studies in international student groups\\n- will be able to present complex historical scenarios\\n- will feel confident about arguing their opinions about refuge seeking  based on historic case studies\\n\\nSection 2: Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is a mixed online lecture and seminar course, which includes online seminars taking place on Wednesdays at 16.-18.00 hrs\\n\\nPlease consider a work-load per week of: 4 hours\\n\\nThe minimum technical requirements you need to participate are: a 5 Mbps Internet connexion and a Zoom account\\n\\nSection 3: Schedule\/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nStarting: 29\/06\/2022\\nEnd: 27\/07\/2022\\nEvaluation period ends on September 31st, 2022\\n\\nOnline program:\\nWe: 16:00 - 18:00\\n\\n+++ Application Process+++\\nStudents in Potsdam will sign up for the seminar on PULS (01.-13.04.2022) and students in Cagliari will need to contact Isabella Soi or Nicola Melis at the following emails:\\n\\nIsabella Soi: i.soi@unica.it\\nNicola Melis: nmelis@unica.it",
