        "description": "**Duration of the internship**\\n3 to 6 months\\n\\n**Hours per week**\\n24 to 35 hours\\n\\n**Preferred start date**\\nNo constraints \\n\\n**Preferred end date**\\nNo constraints \\n\\n**Further information about host organisation and relevant links**\\nThe International Affairs Department of the University of Rennes is made of an international team of 23 administrative staff. The Department is located in a modern and central building in the city of Rennes. Rennes is the capital city of the Brittany Region, in the west part of France. Just 1.5h by train from Paris and 1h from the seaside. Rennes is a vibrant city, with plenty of sports and cultural activities to do.\\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\n**Context**: Nowadays, Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can accurately perform many tasks, such as language processing, image and video classification, audio and radar processing, and instance segmentation [1 - 3]. Recently, large AI applications such as OpenAI GPT-4, Meta LLaMA3, and Mistral Mixture of Experts have captivated public interest with their high accuracy. Those applications demonstrated a high accuracy not only in one specific task but also performed well when processing multimodal data (e.g., a combination of text and images). Recent AI algorithms have also shown outstanding performance in space exploration, as they can process data locally in the satellites and send only useful information to Earth, avoiding unnecessary communication [4, 5]. \\n\\nDue to their resource-intensive nature, AI programs need dedicated hardware accelerators, such as graphics and tensor processing units, to be employed in any application, including space satellites. Unfortunately, the hardware resources necessary to execute current state-of-the-art AI software are highly vulnerable to radiation-induced errors present on space missions. The errors caused by ionizing particles in space can modify the hardware operations and propagate through the software, leading to failures in AI systems. \\n\\nThis research aims to characterize the error rate of AI codes for space exploration. We plan to characterize the impact of faults on AI algorithms with fault injection and propose efficient fault tolerance methods.  \\n\\n**Work proposal**: The student will conduct fault simulation on AI-based systems to simulate faults caused by space radiation. The experiments will be conducted on a Microchip PolarFire System on Chip development board, with various AI algorithms in operation. Following the simulations, we will assess how the faults affect the operating system and the AI algorithms. We can then propose algorithm-level fault tolerance to mitigate system failures resulting from radiation-induced faults. Depending on the project schedule and progress, we may be able to perform accelerated radiation experiments to evaluate the error rate and fault tolerance. \\n\\nRequired skills: \\n- Advanced Computer architecture knowledge \\n- C\/C++ programming \\n- Python Programming \\n- Advanced knowledge of embedded systems \\n- Basics of AI and machine learning \\n- Knowledge of hardware description languages is a plus. \\n\\n*References* : \\n\\n[1] Xiaohua  Zhai et al., Scaling Vision Transformers, IEEE\/CVF CVPR, 2022 \\n[2] Chong Chen, et al., Compound fault diagnosis for industrial robots based on dual-transformer networks, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 2023 \\n[3] Yuxin Fang, et al., EVA-02: A Visual Representation for Neon Genesis, CVPR 2023 \\n[4] Jakubik, J. et al., HLS Foundantion, https:\/\/github.com\/nasa-impact\/hls-foundation-os \\n[5] M.

        "description": "**Duration of the internship**\\n5 to 6 months\\n\\n**Hours per week**\\n35 hours\\n\\n**Preferred start date**\\n03 February 2025 (flexible)\\n\\n**Preferred end date**\\n07 July 2025 (flexible)\\n\\n**Further information about host organisation and relevant links**\\nWebpage of senior supervisor: https:\/\/ipr.univ-rennes.fr\/interlocuteurs\/francois-peaudecerf\\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\nEvaporation from bare soils is a key hydrological process which returns a fifth of terrestrial precipitations directly to the atmosphere. This macroscopic phenomenon is governed at the microscale by capillary flows along water films between the top of the soil and the water at depth. The stability of these films is crucial to have an effective drying and it is highly sensitive to the physico-chemistry of the soil such as the surface tension at air-water interfaces or the contact angle of the aqueous phase with grains [1].  \\n\\nIn soil, bacteria abound, with ~ 1010 bacteria per gram of top soil. Many of them release surface active components – surfactants – in their surroundings which can strongly decrease the surface tension at air-water interfaces and change the contact angle [2]. To date, however, little is known about the potential impact of these bacteria on drying dynamics. How do surfactants accumulate at drying interfaces? Does bacterial behavior, in particular motility by swimming, modify this accumulation dynamics? What are the consequences on the interface behavior inside the soil pores? \\n\\nWe started investigating these questions at the level of the single pore with the PhD project of Nathan Chapelle. We have already started developing an original experimental setup to follow the deformation of a single air-water interface which is put under evaporative forcing in the presence of surfactants, and validated our choice of model bacteria, B.subtilis. The goal of this internship is to get familiar with this setup and to shed light on the role of different bacteria phenotypes (in particular motile vs non-motile) on the repartition of bacteria and surfactants in the bulk and at this air-water interface. To do so, the intern will use microfluidic chips to mimic one pore of the soil, with an air-water interface present. Using optical microscopy techniques, he will track individual bacteria and characterize their behavior during evaporation from the interface. These results will be linked to changes in interface dynamics.  \\n\\nThe intern will be trained in and perform microfabrication by photolithography for microfluidics, microscopic imaging and image processing, particule tracking algorithms to follow individual bacteria as well as standard microbiological culture techniques. \\n\\n*References*: \\n\\n[1] D.
