We consider to focus on the enzyme electrochemical biosensors, notably the glucose biosensor, and on the ion selective electrodes, e.g. calcium. These electrodes are used in the blood glucose and in the blood gas detections.\\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n\\n- learn the basic processes of several biosensors, thermodynamics and kinetics of weak molecular interactions\\n- discover host-guest interactions of bioactive guest molecules with cavity-shaped hosts (cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cavitands, cucurbiturils) and their immobilization onto the glassy carbon or platinum electrode surfaces by electro-polymerization.\\n\\nThis course, offered at 4 European universities, brings together European students from different universities. This unique approach allows students to benefit from a truly international and intercultural learning experience.",

The objective of a sustainable development, set out in the 1987 Brundtland Report and confirmed by the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development, now infuses all European Union law. Regulations designed to protect the environment have been developed, but more broadly the issue of environmental protection has become an integral part of the law relating to economic activities.\\n\\nAt the end of the course, participants will:\\n\\n- Master the concept of sustainable development and its implications for European law\\n- Be familiar with the general legal framework applicable to environmental matters at European level, the principles and the main sectoral regulations\\n- Understand the links with the international level and the obligations of the Member States of the European Union in environmental matters.",
