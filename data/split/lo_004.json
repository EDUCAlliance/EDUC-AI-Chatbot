This illegal market segment operates within an uncontrolled environment, with no restrictions on vendors, consumers or products, in which practically anyone can purchase any type of medication – including counterfeit drugs – without a prescription, medical supervision or appropriate diagnosis, consequently compromising patient and medication safety. International and national authorities lack efficient tools to discover and shut down illicit pharmacy websites and stop the illicit trade of counterfeit medicines. Accordingly, advanced computational methods are needed to detect and mitigate cybercriminal activity, and efficient inter-disciplinary communication and public awareness campaigns to inform consumers.\\nThe course will provide insight into the current issues of the online pharmaceutical market and the dangers of counterfeit medicines. Real world data on legitimate and rogue online pharmacies, various stakeholders, networks, products and information content will be introduced, along with the discussion of measures combating illegal peddling of pharmaceuticals. Novel information technology and data-science methods on the evaluation of this enormous online market will be discussed.\\nStudents can access resources for their individual and group assignment, further the slides of the lectures and further reading material on a designated web based interface.\\n\\nStarting date and finishing of the course: 7th October (Friday) - 2nd December (Friday)\\nSchedule:  synchronous dates: 7th of October (Friday) at 13:00, 4th of November (Friday) at 13:00, 2nd of December (Friday) at 13:00\\n\\nName of teachers: Dr. András Fittler, Dr. Vida Róbert, Dr. Tünde Ambrus, Dr. Tünde Ambrus, Dr. Lenka Smejkalová",

In the continuity of the Mediterranean city-states, this territorial modality of the civitas gave rise to several urban centres surrounded by their own territories, whose juxtaposition durably structured the Roman Empire. \\nOrganised around a community of citizens who governed it, the populus, the city enjoyed a certain autonomy under the same law. Buildings and monuments were the embodiment of this community and represented urbanitas, the urban way of life.\\n\\n**The course will take place from 1st March to 20th May 2023**\\n\\n**Workload: 72h** - The student&#039;s work will consist of following the weekly exercises without notation.\\n\\n**Final assessment:** The evaluation is a final exam, a written test on the questions developed in the practice exercises.",
