In the continuity of the Mediterranean city-states, this territorial modality of the civitas gave rise to several urban centres surrounded by their own territories, whose juxtaposition durably structured the Roman Empire. Organised around a community of citizens who governed it, the populus, the city enjoyed a certain autonomy under the same law. Buildings and monuments were the embodiment of this community and represented urbanitas, the urban way of life.\\n\\nThe objective of the course is to set out the modalities and the timeline of this expansion as well as the acceptance of the Roman Urban in the North West of the Roman Empire as any very first urbanisation in Europe.\\n\\n",

The research center in Rennes is shared with the University of Rennes and other engineering schools, for a total of &gt;700 persons covering most fields of CS. https:\/\/www.inria.fr\/en\/inria-centre-rennes-university  \\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\nReconstructing a dynamic system from its trajectories is an old topic, addressed by several communities. This is called system identification in systems theory, equation discovery in physics, and automata learning in computer science. In CS, one may wish to recover an automaton from words of its language and possibly from counter-examples. Classical “exact” algorithms exist to do so, as the celebrated L-star by D. Angluin, but the latter relies on powerful oracles, i.e. on the possibility to make queries about some words. More recently, new approaches based on artificial neural networks architectures have reached impressive performances on this problem. Beyond performance, they are appealing by several aspects : they are passive methods, relying simply on data-bases of examples (no queries, no need for powerful oracles), they generalize extremely well and can be used as generators, and, focusing on Large Language Models LM, they manage to capture global text features that go beyond classical regularity - spelling, grammar, syntax - as for example style or even meaning. Last but not least, such approximate methods are poorly understood by computer scientists, and proving their reliability remains an issue.  \\n \\nThe objective of this internship is to explore the way various NN-based architectures manage to approximate a regular language, produced by some hidden automaton. The focus will be on the way the notion of discrete state emerges in these continuous space systems, and how reliable they are as approximators of automata. Several research directions are envisioned, that will be adapted to the skills and wishes of the candidate. We mention some of them below.  \\n\\n- Exploring the approximation abilities of recurrent neural networks (RNN). RNNs are good ap- proximators of regular languages, but tend to build quasi discrete approximations resembling local automata. This property has to be further understood by examining how well RNN learn more complex languages, and by measuring the distance between the original language and the one ap- proximated by the RNN. This is both an experimental and a theoretical direction, as no algorithms yet exist to estimate such distances.  \\n\\n- Exploring the robustness of the models learnt by RNN, to identify stable regions of their state space and unstable ones. The effect of extra data on such robustness also has to be characterized.  \\n\\n- Replacing a true automaton by its RNN surrogate (used as a generative model for example) raises questions like its reliability. One would like to verify properties of runs produced by such soft automata, for example safety properties. Few algorithms yet exist for model checking such models, and they mostly focus on static feed-forward NN, not recurrent ones.  \\n\\n- Exploring the properties of other architectures. While RNN have a vanishing memory, other structures like GRU or LSTM provide longer term memory. The approximation abilities of such models have to be better understood, in particular to characterize the family of languages they best suit.  \\n\\nThe ideal candidate should have a taste for formal methods and abilities for experimental work using standard machine learning libraries.  \\n\\nSee more details here https:\/\/people.rennes.inria.fr\/Eric.Fabre\/Master%202%20internship%202024.pdf\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed** \\n- Autonomy\\n- Problem solving\\n- Synthesis of scientific documents\\n- Programming skills (mostly Python + ML libraries) \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\nhttps:\/\/cmi.univ-rennes.fr\/en\/housing\\nAccess to sports facilities on campus \\nHelp to find an accomodation in Rennes or on the campus \\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\nPossible financial support for 1 trip\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nAt least 2 meeting per week with the supervisors.\\nAdditional meetings if needed. \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\nThis 6 months research internship is oriented to MsC students in Computer Science, as part of their fulfilments for graduation. \\nGood students might be offered a PhD track on a related topic (funding secured) \\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n- Formal science  \/  Computer science \\n\\n- Formal science  \/  Mathematics \\n\\n- Applied science  \/  Engineering and technology \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nMaster level 2\\n",

Such systems are prone to stability\\nloss due to communication delays and specific features of the teleoperated environment.\\nTime-domain control approaches that leverage passivity theory have proven a flexible and successful tool in designing stabilizing control strategies that do not rely on the knowledge of a model of the environment. In such methods, however, the stability guarantee comes in general at the cost of a reduction of the level of transparency, i.e., of the degree of fidelity in force rendering at both the local and the remote side. Recent research has shown that some degrees of freedom in the design process can be exploited to improve the transparency of a given task under the stability constraint.\\n\\nThe objective of this research work is to design and evaluate novel time-domain stabilizing control strategies for multidimensional multi-user teleoperation systems aimed at the maximization of the level of transparency by means of online optimization.\\n\\nThe work will address the following points, tuned according on the expertise and interests\\nof the student:\\n-\\tTheoretical development and simulation of transparency-preserving control strategies based on convex optimization.\\n-\\tSoftware development for real-time implementation of the designed methods on real-world teleoperation systems.\\n-\\tExperimental evaluation and comparison of the performance of the developed control strategies.

This sharing of control allows the human operator to benefit from the support of the autonomous system while retaining a certain degree of control over the robot. The autonomous controller can assist the human user by regulating the robot&#039;s movements to follow the operator&#039;s commands and\\nby performing autonomous actions to optimize the robot&#039;s trajectory and task execution more efficiently. Shared control is particularly useful in complex tasks that require high precision or are performed in challenging or dangerous environments. The resulting motion of the robot is a combination of the user&#039;s input and the action of the\\nautonomous controller, which is the result of one or more cost functions defined based on the task to be performed, such as maximizing the distance from workspace boundaries or minimizing the energy required by the robot. In these cases, haptic feedback can be highly beneficial in informing the human user about the actions of the autonomous controller [Abi- Farraj, Firas, et al., 2019; Selvaggio, Mario, et al., 2021]. Haptic feedback provides a deeper understanding of the actions taken by the autonomous controller, thereby enhancing the operator&#039;s trust in the decisions made by the autonomous system and enabling smoother collaboration between humans and machines. This synergy between the human operator and the autonomous controller improves the overall efficiency of robotic teleoperation and leads to more satisfactory outcomes in task accomplishment. Indeed, shared control enables to combine the precision of autonomous robotic systems with the cognitive capabilities of human operators. However, it may be challenging to define\\nhow to best share the control of the robotic system in a way that is applicable to different users, tasks, and environments.\\n\\nOur objective is to devise a shared-control approach, which adapts, relying also on haptic feedback, the allocation of control authority at run-time, according to the current confidence of the autonomous controller and performance of the user. This division is enforced through an input-mixing shared-control method, where the inputs from the automation and the human operator are weighted according to our authority distribution. At the current stage, the proposed technique is validated in a robotic cutting task: the users receive haptic feedback to inform them of the authority distribution in addition to the cutting constraints and the contact forces.\\n\\nAs extension of this work, we would like to analyse the effectiveness of the solution not only in terms of guidance but also for teaching more complicated tasks, e.g., how to move in a cluttered environment, as well as compare the proposed mixed-input approach with a haptic shared control method that changes the haptic feedback based on the measured robot and user confidence. The confidence metric introduced in this work can be then tested and validated in other robotic applications, such as drone navigation in cluttered environments.\\n\\nThe proposed workplan consists of\\n- Orientation and understanding of the problem: analysis and review of the relevant literature to\\nunderstand the control authority problem in the domain of robot shared-control strategies.\\n(Month 1).\\n- Preliminary hands-on session: familiarization with the experimental setup, the robotic\\nmanipulator arm, the haptic interface and the existing software for the robotic cutting task.\\n- First preliminary experiments to collect new data to be analysed (M2).\\n- Solution enhancement and first experimental campaign: Implementation and validation of\\npossible improvements that could enhance the proposed shared-control solution for the robotic\\ncutting task.

Humans can provide supervision and decision for the team extending the resilience of the team during long missions. Therefore, the objective will be to provide the software tools to deploy multiple robots, make them cooperate and allows the use user to define the mission plan.

The prediction may be inaccurate but the computational advantages are tempting for practical applications. The candidate will investigate the application of models such as GPT-4 to conduct different multi-robot planning tasks with human operator feedback.

By moving this focal point fast enough, it is the possible to spread the energy along the trajectory, and therefore haptically stimulate the hand if it is close enough [2]. These interfaces can thus generate tactile stimuli in mid-air, without the need for any wearable equipment. \\n \\nIn addition, tactile feedback is often used as a means to convey information (e.g. texture, force, ...) through touch. With a UMH interface, we can represent this information using the shape of the stimulus and it’s set of rendering parameters. It is therefore important to understand how well we can discriminate between several tactile stimuli, using different parameters. In terms of geometry, shapes can for instance vary in position, rotation and scale. While the discrimination in position [3] and rotation [3, 4] has been partially investigated, scale has received less interest. \\n \\nAmong the many possibilities, circular patterns are often used because of their geometric and perceptual properties (e.g. rotation invariance, area maximisation for a given perimeter, ...) [5, 6]. It is therefore important to study our performance in discriminating tactile circles of different sizes, in order to optimise their rendering. \\n \\nThis project consists of several steps: \\n- Getting familiar with ultrasound mid-air haptic rendering. \\n- Determinin which discrimination strategies can be used by participants to try to discriminate between two stimuli. This will allow us to design experiments where only geometric cues can be used. \\n- Designing, implementing, and conducting user studies to measure human discrimination performance for circles of different sizes. \\n- Analyzing the obtained data to verify our hypotheses and compute perceptual metrics. \\n- Depending on the remaining time and the quality of the results, we may write and submit a scientific paper. \\n \\n[1] Rakkolainen, I., Freeman, E., Sand, A., Raisamo, R., &amp; Brewster, S.

Due to its highly aromatic and apolar structure, lignin is supposed to be hard to degrade by soil microbial communities and to accumulate in soils, notably in waterlogged wetland soils. Consequently, wetland soils are today considered as major carbon sinks and play a major role in the global carbon cycle and in climate change mitigation strategies. However, recent work on environmental archaeal phyla, such as Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methermicoccus shengliensis and two stable enrichments of representatives of the class Bathyarchaeia, evidenced novel metabolic pathways to specifically degrade lignin in marine anoxic settings with comparable geochemical functioning as wetlands. This finding could challenge the assumed capacity of anoxic settings, such as wetlands, to sequester high amounts of organic carbon. The objective of this internship is to test the presence of these specific lignin degradation pathways in soils collected in a wetland of the Ploemeur-Guidel critical zone observatory (56, Brittany). Previous metagenomic analysis of these soils revealed high abundances of the recently-discovered archaeal taxon Ca. Bathyarchaeia and comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of genomes assembled from these metagenomes predicted the presence of the enzymes catalyzing lignin degradation. The work will be based on the stable isotope probing technique where 13C-enriched lignin-based substrates are provided to soil incubations. Incorporation of the labeled 13C within the biomass of Ca. Bathyarchaeia will be assessed by the analysis of the carbon isotopic composition of archaeal lipid biomarkers by gas-chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS).\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n-\\tAbility to work in an interdisciplinary team \\n-\\tAbility in organising and planning\\n-\\tAbility to analyse and synthesise \\n-\\tAbility to adapt to new situations \\n-\\tAbility to work autonomously\\n-\\tProblem solving\\n-\\tConcern for quality\\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\n- Link on how to find an accomodation in Rennes : https:\/\/cmi.univ-rennes.fr\/en\/housing\\n- An office and a computer will be provided as well as all the necessary furniture. \\n- The trainne will receive a specific training in health &amp; safety regulations in the lab.\\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nThe trainee will be co-supervised by an assistant professor (S.

Most of the time, in such collaborative missions, the field of interest is relatively large with respect to the size of the multi-robot system. Therefore, the swarm must be divided into smaller groups (clusters) to move towards different areas and conduct different tasks simultaneously.\\nMotivations: Most of the current works addressing the problem of clustering for multi-agent systems are concerned with generic unconstrained agents, thus neglecting the constraints and specificity of networks of mobile robots in terms of limited sensing capabilities. Moreover, they only study the conditions for convergence of the agents to small groups, i.e. cluster consensus, rather than the autonomous formation of clusters. There are few works addressing the autonomous achievement of clusters in a network of mobile robots based on distributed and local interactions among the robots, none of which take also into account the sensing constraints inherent to these types of systems.\\nGeneral Objectives: The goal of this Master Thesis is to design and validate theoretically (using Lyapunov methods, graph theory, etc.) novel control laws for the autonomous achievement of cluster consensus of a swarm of robotic vehicles subject to sensing constraints (limited range, limited field of view) based on local and distributed interaction laws among the robots.

While a fixed number of cooperative robotic agents may be capable of performing “simple” short-term tasks such as, e.g., formation tracking, flocking, or area coverage, it may prove limiting in many practical scenarios. Indeed, as the field advances, applications of multi-robot systems are starting to shift from such relatively simple tasks, to more complex long-term and persistent missions that require the robots to be deployed for longer periods of time, usually surpassing the battery-charge duration of the devices, forcing individual robots to leave the network for recharging and (possibly) returning when fully charged. Moreover, as tasks get more complex and are designed for dynamic and, often, antagonistic environments, failure of individual robots due to malfunctioning or attacks cannot always be prevented. Equivalently, when addressing tasks in uncertain or unknown environments, in order to successfully accomplish the mission, new robots may be required to join the system dynamically as the task specification or the environment evolve. Usually during the development of a mission both the addition and removal of agents are bound to happen, oftentimes, simultaneously.\\nAn Open Multi-Robot System (OMRS) is a system of multiple cooperative robots where agents can be added or removed. Recently, in our team we have started considering the coordination of OMRS in an passivity-aware framework [1] based on the concepts of impulsive switched systems, passivity, and energy-tanks, that allows the OMRS to handle the addition and removal of agents (or groups thereof) autonomously while preserving the passivity of the system.\\nGeneral Objectives: The goal of this Master Thesis is to build upon the passivity-aware coordination framework for OMRS to design a complex and long-term mission on a fleet of quadrotor UAVs, e.g., a long-term surveillance and target-tracking mission, and implement it in simulation and experimentally.\\nEnvisaged Activities:\\n- Literature review of the related works and familiarize with the experimental setup in the team.\\n- Design a long-term mission scenario based on the open Multi-agent system framework for a fleet of UAVs.\\n- Develop and implement in simulation an algorithm for the proposed mission.\\n- Setup the experimental scenario and validate the algorithms on a fleet of Crazyflie drones.\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Teamwork \\n- Ability to work in an international context \\n- Ability to generate new ideas (creativity) \\n- Ability to work autonomously \\n- Problem solving \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\n- Link on how to find an accomodation in Rennes :\\nhttps:\/\/cmi.univ-rennes.fr\/en\/housing\\n- Access to sports facilities on campus \\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nMeeting frequency with supervisor: at least once a week \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\n- High motivation and interest in the topic \\n\\n- Good knowledge in control theory and robot modeling \\n\\n- Good experience using Python\/C++, ROS2 and Matlab\/Simulink \\n\\n- Basic knowledge of control and analysis of multi-agent systems is appreciated \\n\\n- Scientific curiosity \\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n- Applied science  \/  Engineering and technology \\n\\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nMaster level 1\\nMaster level 2\\n",

Tissue biopsies remain the gold standard to profile these markers for most cancers. However, the procedure is invasive, painful and carries some risks. Therefore, complementary applications using non-invasive biomarkers are of great interest. Liquid biopsies better cover disease heterogeneity and allow serial sampling. This helps to better characterize the molecular profile of the tumor and follow disease evolution. \\nTumor cells, like other cells in the body; release extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing various molecules such as RNAs and proteins. These EVs can be found in all body fluids, such as blood, and emerged as potential circulating biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of treatment response since they reflect the molecular events occurring in the tumor. The aim of this study is to determine the clinical value of circulating RNAs, associated or not to EVs, for better patient management.  \\nThe internship will be dedicated to define an optimized and reproducible protocol to isolate EVs from plasma with a high efficiency and a low contamination in lipoproteins. This will include characterization of EVs by Western Blot and NanoTracking Analysis. Finally, once the SEC protocol will be optimized, we will investigate RNAs in EV-enriched and unprocessed plasma to determine the best source of transcript biomarkers.  \\n \\nKeywords: extracellular vesicles, circulating biomarkers, liquid biopsies, transcripts cancers \\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Ability in organising and planning \\n- Ability to apply knowledge in practice  \\n- Concern for quality  \\n- Ability to work autonomously  \\n- Ability to analyse and synthesise \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\nhttps:\/\/cmi.univ-rennes.fr\/en\/housing\\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nAt least 1 meeting per week \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\n- Vaccinations against hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus and polyomyelitis is mandatory \\n- Background in oncology, biochemistry and molecular biology \\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\nApplied science  \/  Medicine and health (molecular biology\/cell biology) \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nMaster level 1\\nMaster level 2\\n",

These observations, combined with in situ measurements, provide invaluable information on the chemical and physical conditions prevailing during the formation of the solar system. The density of cometary atmospheres is such that thermodynamic equilibrium cannot be systematically maintained. It is therefore important to study the collisional excitation of cometary molecules induced by heavy projectiles such as CO, CO2 or H2O, in order to make the most of the observations. In this project, we propose to use new methods for obtaining these data. Centrifugal decoupling methods and especially statistical approaches will be the methods of choice for such studies, as they keep computation times reasonable while offering relatively accurate data. In parallel, we will introduce the new data into radiative transfer codes with the aim of interpreting recent and future observations of cometary atmospheres, and thus making the most of these observations. \\n\\nKeywords: astrochemistry, comets, quantum physics\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Elementary computer skills \\n- Ability to generate new ideas (creativity) \\n- Ability to work in an international context \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\n- Link on how to find an accomodation in Rennes : https:\/\/cmi.univ-rennes.fr\/en\/housing  \\n- Access to sports facilities on campus \\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\n- On site training\\n\\n- Frequent group meetings \\n\\n- Co-supervision by PhD students \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\nNone\\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n\\n- Natural science  \/  Chemistry\\n- Natural science  \/  Physics \\n- Natural science  \/  Astronomy \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nMaster level 1\\nMaster level 2\\n",

The work will be supervised jointly by Tristan Allard (PhD, HDR) associate professor at the University of Rennes, expert in privacy in data intensive systems, and Barbara FILA (PhD, HDR), associate professor at INSA Rennes, expert in formal methods for risk assessment. \\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\nContext :\\nLarge volumes of personal data are nowadays collected by private companies or public organisations. Typical examples include health records, geolocation, electricity consumption, or social networks. Various legal, monetary, or visibility incentives encourage data holders to share anonymized versions of the collected datasets. On the one hand, data publishing is useful because it allows to strengthen scientific studies, to favor industrial innovation, or to establish appropriate public policies. Numerous open data repositories are well known today and their number keeps growing. On the other hand, publishing personal data must be done with \\ncare in order to provide strong privacy guarantees. Failing to safeguard privacy may lead to severe consequences on individuals or companies. To preserve privacy, privacy-preserving data publishing techniques are used. Today’s typical techniques include ad-hoc aggregation, k-anonymous generalization [3, 4], or differentially private perturbation [1]. Their aim is to ensure that the published data enjoy (hopefully strong enough) privacy guarantees. Security is \\nhowever a constant race between the attackers and the defenders. A large number of attacks on privacy-preserving data publishing algorithms exists today and keeps growing [2]. \\n \\nObjective :\\nThe objective of this project is to develop a formal framework (see, e.g., [6]) allowing to analyze risks relevant to privacy-preserving data publishing (see, e.g., [5]). \\n \\nThe tasks of the student will be to: \\n- Perform a systematic analysis of the state of the art on existing privacy-preserving data publishing techniques and related attacks. \\n- Analyze existing attacks in order to identify aspects and\/or parameters (e.g., privacy loss, usability, attacker’s background knowledge) that should be taken into account while analyzing the risks relevant to a privacy-preserving data publishing technique. \\n- Propose a taxonomy of relevant attackers, based on aspects such as adversarial goals, background knowledge, reasoning methods, computational capabilities, etc. \\n- Develop a model allowing to evaluate privacy risks in the personal data publishing context. \\n \\nReferences :\\n[1] Cynthia Dwork.

Collagen is the structural protein par excellence, and is used throughout the animal kingdom as the main constituent of tissues ranging from bone and skin to cornea. The mechanical properties of collagen are highly variable and can be adapted to the function of the tissue it constitutes. Mechanical properties are controlled at the nanoscopic scale by the protein&#039;s amino acid sequence, its level of cross-linking and its degree of hydration. But that&#039;s not all - there are other ingredients missing! At present, the molecular models used to simulate collagen properties are not mechanically stable, and collagen structure degrades or disassembles under conditions of ambient pressure and temperature. However, collagen - and therefore our skin - is stable under these conditions. The structure of collagen is therefore still a matter of debate [1]. \\n\\nThe aim of the internship will be to refine an existing molecular model of fibrillar collagen  which is currently unstable due to existing internal stresses. Work will consist in including macromolecules and cross-links to our current molecular model. The improved model will then be simulated using a molecular dynamics approach to study the stability of the tertiary structure and predict the mechanical properties of fibrillar collagen. \\n\\nThe simulation tool is based on existing tools: (i) reliable interatomic potentials obtained at the quantum scale to establish the interactions between atoms, and (ii) an optimized molecular dynamics simulator (LAMMPS). Once the tool has been established, parallelized simulations will be carried out on high-performance computers, with detailed analysis to determine the relationships between composition, structure and viscoelastic properties. \\n\\n[1] Orgel, J.

However, this balance can be disrupted by various endogenous or exogenous factors, leading to intestinal dysbiosis (diseases). Intestinal dysbiosis is a modification in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which may be correlated with the onset of certain intestinal pathologies, such as Crohn&#039;s disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes or colorectal cancer. Bacteria such as Salmonella are increased and persist in the intestine, while other commensal bacterial species are reduced, such as Bacteroides fragilis, Roseburia intestinalis and Akkermansia muciniphila, which are considered to be potential new generation probiotics. These potential new-generation probiotics can produce bacterial metabolites with beneficial effects in the intestine and other organs. However, mechanisms remain to be elucidated, in particular the study of the effects of a probiotic community on the intestinal epithelium, pathogenic bacteria and inflammation. \\n\\nThe project of the internship will focus on studying the metabolic behavior of several gut bacterial species alone or in community to mimic gut microbiota. At first, we will evaluate the capacity of bacteria to growth, to produce metabolites. After that, we will investigate the impact of these bacteria or their metabolites on host by using an original model, mimicking the intestinal epithelium, that we have developed in the Numecan Institut.  \\n\\nThe methods that will be developed are: Bibliography search, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture, cell culture (complex model composed of 5 human cell lines), RT-qPCR, trans-epithelial resistance measurement, toxicity measurement, GC-MS for metabolites).\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Ability to analyse and synthesise  \\n- Ability to apply knowledge in practice  \\n- Teamwork  \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\n\\n- Link on how to find an accomodation in Rennes : https:\/\/cmi.univ-rennes.fr\/en\/housing  \\n- Access to sports facilities on campus \\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nNo allowance\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nEvery day \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\n- Knowledge in microbiology and cellular culture \\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n- Applied science  \/  Medicine and health  \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nBachelor or Master\\n",
