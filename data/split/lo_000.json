        "description": "In the traditional historiographical narrative, the arrival of the “barbarians” corresponds to the end of the greatest civilization of the antique Mediterranean: the Roman Empire. But was the situation so simple? Who were these “barbarians”? And did the Empire really collapse or was it rather transformed? The goal of this course is to focus on the artistic, visual, material, and performative cultures that coexisted in this extraordinary moment of history. To reach this objective, we will firstly focus on the prejudices constructed from the Renaissance to our days about what was commonly considered as the “Dark Ages”. Secondly, we will be investigating the role of medias in the transformations of visual history: from sculptures to “bidimensional” images, from roll to codex, from the illusive image to the iconic one. Third, we will analyze the role played by the meeting of cultures – constitutive for the investigated period – in the birth of the “Middle Ages”.\\n\\nThis course is taught by the Department of Art History at Masaryk University.

We study multilingual sources of the historical collection from 1812\/1815 and examine the specific adaptation and redaction of these sources for different reading publics. In this research process, we will profit from the linguistic diversity of the participants of the course (in the ideal case: with a collective of students that are German, Italian, French, Czech or Hungarian native speakers). The main course language will be German, however (so it aims primarily at students in the German departments of the partnership Universities). Apart from this historical-critical approach, we will observe modern transformations of Grimms’ Fairy Tales in different media (literature, performative arts and film), including the most recent adaptations in contemporary popculture such as Terry Gilliams fantasy movie “Brothers Grimm” (2005).\\n\\nAt the end of the seminar, participants will:\\n- have profound knowledge on Grimms&#039; collection of fairy tales\\n- be able to critically examine and compare historical sources\\n- develop the competency to observe and describe the transformation of literary motives\\n- discover the adaption of fairy tales in different media\\n\\n\\nSection 2: Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThe course will be taught in a digital format, including both synchronous (weekly zoom-meetings) and asynchronous (moodle-based source collection, videos and task assignments) modes of teaching.
