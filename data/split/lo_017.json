From conducting a simulated trial to visiting courts and penitentiaries, you&#039;ll gain practical insights into criminal proceedings in the Czech Republic and compare them with your home country&#039;s legal system.\\n\\nThe course will provide participants with deep insight into Czech criminal proceedings. The participants will acquire basic knowledge about basics of criminal liability according to Czech law, as necessary basis for understanding the purpose of criminal proceedings. During the course, the concept of criminal proceedings, its principles, subjects, evidence and stages will be discussed.\\n\\nAfter that, the students will be given materials to prepare simulated main trial that will be conducted by them at the end of the course. In the second week, visit of selected institutions (courts, public prosecutor&#039;s office, penitentiary) will follow, in order to connect theoretical concepts with practice and to allow students to discuss their ideas with lawyers from practice.

        "description": "Debate as an educational method that\\nenhances students’ critical thinking and argumentation skills. Debate is a formal\\nmethod of interactive and representational argument. With its focus on logical\\nconsistency, factual accuracy, originality of arguments and to some degree of emotional\\nappeal to the audience, debating develops the art of persuasion. It also expands our\\nunderstanding of different dilemmas and controversies in our society and gives us a\\nway of resolving our misunderstandings and conflicts in a peaceful manner.  It is also a great tool for non-native English language speakers, as it gives them an\\nopportunity to practice their English, improve their vocabulary and verbal\\ncommunication skills. A university with a debating society gains an active student body\\nand it adequately prepares its students for the challenges of today’s demanding labor\\nmarket and the complexity of the society we live in. Finally, debate fosters active and\\ninformed citizenry through promotion of deliberative and participatory democratic\\nvalues which are based on anti-discrimination, tolerance and dialogue.\\n\\n###Dates\\nJuly 20 - August 2\\n\\n###Link to programme website\\nhttps:\/\/summerschool.pte.hu\/programs\/public-speaking-and-debate-academy\\n\\n###Scholarships\\nStudents should contact coordinators at home university for information about scholarships\\n\\n- Université de Rennes: educ@univ-rennes.fr\\n- Université de Paris Nanterre:activites.educ@liste.parisnanterre.fr\\n- Universitat Jaume I: Fermín Mallén (fmallen@uji.es)        \\n- University of South-Eastern Norway: Kine Korsmo (kine.korsmo@usn.no)\\n- University of Cagliari: Fabio Sorrentino (educ@unica.it)\\n- University of Pécs: Boglárka Vecsánin (summerschoolpecs@pte.hu)\\n- University of Potsdam: Judith Rode (isco@uni-potsdam.de)\\n- Masaryk University: Mai Hoa Nguyenová (nguyenova@czs.muni.cz)\\n\\n\\n\\n",
