To avoid the occurrence of such crisis or to reduce its magnitude, it is argued that more regulations are required. Regulations are indeed  tools to shape economic systems. As such, they have tremendous impacts on economic growth and  the well-being of population. \\nIf the content of regulations is to be known when strategies are considered, it is especially crucial  for both lawyers and policy makers to understand the foundations of these regulations. For lawyers,  it helps to develop innovative interpretations and powerful arguments; for policy makers to  understand the consequences and the inherent limits of their actions while also providing tools to  apprehend and criticize existing regulations.  \\nThis course will inquire into the reasons for regulations, the options that are available when a  regulation is considered, their limits and the strategies to deal with them. \\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students with the necessary tools to develop, question and  criticize regulations.",

However,the speedy technological advancement created issues that did not exist in the past –or at least not to such an extent as today. As such the course also involves an in-depth analysis of cybercrime and EU criminal law designed to tackle  it  (among  others  the  European Production  Order  and  the  European  Preservation  Order  will  be introduced in the course). Last,but not least the protection of fundamental rights must be emphasised since EU criminal law is a policy area which greatly affects the freedom of EU citizens (in this context the principle of mutual trust, the ne bis in idem principleand the practice of the Court of Justice of the European Union shall be presented).\\nTimetable: From 10 February - on Thursdays at 14:00\\n \\n\\n\\n",
