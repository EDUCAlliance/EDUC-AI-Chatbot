Secondly, we will be investigating the role of medias in the transformations of visual history: from sculptures to “bidimensional” images, from roll to codex, from the illusive image to the iconic one. Third, we will analyze the role played by the meeting of cultures – constitutive for the investigated period – in the birth of the “Middle Ages”.\\n\\nThis course is taught by the Department of Art History at Masaryk University. \\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n- be able to orientate himself in the visual and material cultures of the Late Antique to Early Medieval world;\\n- understand the tools and the importance of visual culture within social and historical phenomena;\\n- fall in love with art history!",
