        "description": "#### Learning objectives\\n\\n”My Culture and Yours: A Workshop Exploring Our Thinking, Languages, and Identity” is a pilot project hosted by the language centers of the University of Potsdam and Tel Aviv University—respectively the Center for Language and Key Competences (Zessko) and Center for Language Excellence (CLE)—to create a COIL version of a language café. Extending the invitation to partake in the workshop to the language centers and students of the EDUC partner universities of the University of Potsdam, Zessko and CLE offer a three-session COIL in which students will get the chance to explore their own definition of culture, reflect on their own language and cultural background, practice communicating in English, and become acquainted with the new cultures and stories from their fellow participants. These themes will be mediated in story-telling and predominantly oral activities. In this virtual learning setting, students enhance their language proficiency in English as well as their intercultural communicative competence and are asked 1) to  embrace the opportunities that come with experiencing cultural diversity and 2) to then answer the overarching core question of this workshop about one’s own cultural identity; 3) to respect individual difference and shared global values, and 4) to ultimately rise to the EDUC’s mission statement of creating an inclusive and diverse digital space for intercultural exchange and discourse.\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is **virtual**, and **synchronous**.\\n\\nPlease consider a total work-load of: 4.5 hours (participation EDUC Certificate)\\n\\n#### Schedule\/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nNumber of hours: **1.5 h per session**\\n\\nSessions on: 18\/06\/2024, 25\/06\/2024 and 09\/07\/2024\\n\\n|      Time     \\t| Mo | Tu \\t| We | Th | Fr \\t|\\n|:-------------:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|\\n| 9:00 - 10:30 \\t|    \\t|   x\\t|    \\t|    \\t|    \\t| (Berlin time)\\n\\n",

But was the situation so simple? Who were these “barbarians”? And did the Empire really collapse or was it rather transformed? The goal of this course is to focus on the artistic, visual, material, and performative cultures that coexisted in this extraordinary moment of history. To reach this objective, we will firstly focus on the prejudices constructed from the Renaissance to our days about what was commonly considered as the “Dark Ages”. Secondly, we will be investigating the role of medias in the transformations of visual history: from sculptures to “bidimensional” images, from roll to codex, from the illusive image to the iconic one. Third, we will analyze the role played by the meeting of cultures – constitutive for the investigated period – in the birth of the “Middle Ages”.\\n\\nThis course is taught by the Department of Art History at Masaryk University. \\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n- be able to orientate himself in the visual and material cultures of the Late Antique to Early Medieval world;\\n- understand the tools and the importance of visual culture within social and historical phenomena;\\n- fall in love with art history!",
