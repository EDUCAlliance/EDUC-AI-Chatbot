By engaging in the first three chapters, learners can achieve the necessary competence level to continue learning in the synchronous German A1 course (with weekly Zoom meetings), which is also available for EDUC universities. If you would like to do the synchronous German A1 course, please allow sufficient time to complete this German A1 Starter course beforehand.\\n\\nThe course comprises learning objects related to typical areas of communication and basic needs in a German speaking community.  Learners can explore the material along the steps Understanding (units with language input along with reflexion exercises and linguistic explanations) Training (mainly vocab and grammar exercises), Testing (quizzes about language use) and Broadening the perspective (additional material from the internet). To ensure learners can manage without a tutor, all exercises come with either computer feedback or an answer key. \\n\\nUpon successfully engaging in this course, learners: \\n\\n- can recognise concrete information (e.g. places and times) on familiar topics encountered in everyday life, provided it is delivered slowly and clearly. \\n- can understand some expressions when people are discussing them: personal and academic life, hobbies or surroundings, provided the delivery is slow and clear. \\n- can understand very short, simple texts a single phrase at a time, picking up familiar names, words and basic phrases. \\n- can make an introduction and use basic greeting and leave-taking expressions. \\n- can ask for food and drink using basic expressions. \\n- can handle numbers, quantities, cost and time (can-do statements according to the CEFR). \\n\\n",

        "description": "Programme Description: the lecture course for students in the BA English Studies programme offers an overview of British literature and culture from the medieval period to the beginning of the Victorian era. Its aim is to provide basic information about the socio-cultural environment in which major cultural and literary events took place. The course is held by three instructors, depending on the topic at hand. The course relies on primary readings and highly recommended reference materials, which are made available online for students.\\nGeneral objectives: students completing this survey course will \\n--have an overview of British literary history from the Middle Ages to the Victorian period, \\n--improve their analytic skills through the exploration of connections between literary texts and their different historical, social and cultural contexts, \\n--be better equipped for the analysis of literary texts in a variety of genres, \\n--learn about the emergence and early history of literary genres popular today, \\n--make a connection between current cultural, medial and literary events and trends, and their literary-historical precedents. \\nShort-term achievements: by attending the lecture course, students will gain information on the best canonical writers, their works, and the historical and cultural contexts of the discussed literary periods. The assessment of the course will be based on a final written exam covering the topics discussed during the sessions as well as the primary readings.\\nLong-term achievements: the course is an essential part of the English Studies BA programme. Teaching literary histories is part of the curricula of English Studies programmes in BA courses in Europe. We plan to reach undergraduate students from the universities participating in the EDUC consortium. The lecture course will contribute to their knowledge of English literary and cultural studies of which this lecture course on British Literature and Culture I is an essential part. \\n\\nTeachers: Dr. Gabriella Hartvig (University of P√©cs), Dr. Filip Bul Krajn√≠k (Masaryk University Brno), Dr. Csaba Maczelka (University of P√©cs)",
