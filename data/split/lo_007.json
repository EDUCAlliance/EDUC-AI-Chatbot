But was the situation so simple? Who were these “barbarians”? And did the Empire really collapse or was it rather transformed? The goal of this course is to focus on the artistic, visual, material, and performative cultures that coexisted in this extraordinary moment of history. To reach this objective, we will firstly focus on the prejudices constructed from the Renaissance to our days about what was commonly considered as the “Dark Ages”. Secondly, we will be investigating the role of medias in the transformations of visual history: from sculptures to “bidimensional” images, from roll to codex, from the illusive image to the iconic one. Third, we will analyze the role played by the meeting of cultures – constitutive for the investigated period – in the birth of the “Middle Ages”.\\n\\nThis course is taught by the Department of Art History at Masaryk University. \\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n- be able to orientate himself in the visual and material cultures of the Late Antique to Early Medieval world;\\n- understand the tools and the importance of visual culture within social and historical phenomena;\\n- fall in love with art history!\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is **asynchronous**, which means that this is an e-learning course (e-learning materials + final essay).\\n\\nPlease consider a workload per the whole course of 125 hours (25 hours\/1 ECTS).",

Consequently, it does neither claim to “cover” the whole level A1 according to the CEFR nor to provide A1 exam training. Instead, it is to empower successful participants to take their first steps in a German speaking surrounding and – equally important – to manage their further language acquisition.\\n\\nUpon successfully engaging in this course, learners:\\n- can recognise concrete information (e.g., places and times) on familiar topics encountered in everyday life, provided it is delivered slowly and clearly.\\n- can understand some expressions when people are discussing them: personal and academic life, hobbies or surroundings, provided the delivery is slow and clear.\\n- can understand instructions addressed carefully and slowly to them and follow short, simple directions.\\n- can understand very short, simple texts a single phrase at a time, picking up familiar names, words and basic phrases.\\n- can guess the probable meaning of an unknown word\/sign that is similar to one in the language they normally use.\\n- can produce simple, mainly isolated phrases about people, time and places.\\n- can ask and answer simple questions, initiate and respond to simple statements in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.\\n- can make an introduction and use basic greeting and leave-taking expressions.\\n- can ask for food and drink using basic expressions.\\n- can handle numbers, quantities, cost and time (can-do statements according to the CEFR).\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nMode: Regular video meetings via Zoom (language learning discussions, collaborative task-based learning) connected with asynchronous individual learning through Moodle (learning videos, exercises and quizzes, assignments).\\n\\n**Workload: 180 h (*equivalent to 6 ECTS)**\\n\\n#### Schedule\/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nStarting: 08\/04\/2024\\nEnd: 19\/07\/2024\\n\\nExam: most likely mid-July 2024\\n\\nWeekly video meetings (Zoom):\\n**presumably Thursdays: weekly, 16:00 - 19:30 h (to be confirmed)**\\n\\n### Certificate\\nCertificate of attendance, Zessko&#039;s A1 certificate upon passing the A1 exam, digital documents will be made available via Moodle.",

        "description": "Section 1: Learning objectives\\n\\nThis intensive blended course delves into the global history of processes of refuge-seeking: it explores the many challenges that refugees and migrants face and the opportunities they create in receiving countries. It engages the manifold ways in which citizens have responded to migrants and refugees over time – from the Huguenots’ arrival in Brandenburg-Prussia in 1685 to the present – and in various places, including France, Australia, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Germany. The course also examines the responses and visions of migrants and refugees themselves.\\n\\nThe course brings together 30 students from six European universities through the European Digital UniverCity alliance (EDUC), for ten weeks of online learning (starting on April 17, 2022) followed by a week together in Potsdam June 24-29, 2024. In Potsdam students will meet with local decision-makers, civil society and church representatives, and migrants and refugees to learn first-hand about practices and issues relating to migration and integration.\\n\\nTo prepare for this, students will be introduced to theories around integration and will then engage with historic and contemporary case studies that highlight particular issues such as culture, religion, racism, education, and labour in relation to assimilationism and multiculturalism.\\n\\nOverall, the aim of this course is to provide students with the theoretical and conceptual language to make sense of historical processes of refuge-seeking and integration as well as enabling a lively exchange between student perspectives and practitioners’ insights on processes of integration in the city of Potsdam.\\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n- develop an understanding of integration \/ multiculturalism \/ assimilation\\n- develop an understanding of historic roots of present-day integration challenges\\n- realize the global scale of integration measures\\n- reflect on interconnections between refugee and migration integration\\n- develop critical reading and reflection skills\\n-develop analysis of primary and secondary sources skills\\n- develop teamwork skills\\n-develop oral and written presentation skills\\n- develop intercultural skills\\n-develop transfer skills from historic case studies to present circumstances\\n\\nSection 2: Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is a “blended” one, which means that it is divided in two phases: an Online Program from April 19th to June 14th, 2022 consisting of one lesson every Tuesday from 16:00 to 18:00 h.
