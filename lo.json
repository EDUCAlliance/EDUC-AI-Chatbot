        "description": "In the traditional historiographical narrative, the arrival of the “barbarians” corresponds to the end of the greatest civilization of the antique Mediterranean: the Roman Empire. But was the situation so simple? Who were these “barbarians”? And did the Empire really collapse or was it rather transformed? The goal of this course is to focus on the artistic, visual, material, and performative cultures that coexisted in this extraordinary moment of history. To reach this objective, we will firstly focus on the prejudices constructed from the Renaissance to our days about what was commonly considered as the “Dark Ages”. Secondly, we will be investigating the role of medias in the transformations of visual history: from sculptures to “bidimensional” images, from roll to codex, from the illusive image to the iconic one. Third, we will analyze the role played by the meeting of cultures – constitutive for the investigated period – in the birth of the “Middle Ages”.\\n\\nThis course is taught by the Department of Art History at Masaryk University.

We study multilingual sources of the historical collection from 1812/1815 and examine the specific adaptation and redaction of these sources for different reading publics. In this research process, we will profit from the linguistic diversity of the participants of the course (in the ideal case: with a collective of students that are German, Italian, French, Czech or Hungarian native speakers). The main course language will be German, however (so it aims primarily at students in the German departments of the partnership Universities). Apart from this historical-critical approach, we will observe modern transformations of Grimms’ Fairy Tales in different media (literature, performative arts and film), including the most recent adaptations in contemporary popculture such as Terry Gilliams fantasy movie “Brothers Grimm” (2005).\\n\\nAt the end of the seminar, participants will:\\n- have profound knowledge on Grimms&#039; collection of fairy tales\\n- be able to critically examine and compare historical sources\\n- develop the competency to observe and describe the transformation of literary motives\\n- discover the adaption of fairy tales in different media\\n\\n\\nSection 2: Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThe course will be taught in a digital format, including both synchronous (weekly zoom-meetings) and asynchronous (moodle-based source collection, videos and task assignments) modes of teaching. It will be held in co-teaching (both Vinzenz Hoppe and Kaspar Renner present in all sessions plus additional guest lecturers and experts).\\n\\nPlease consider a work-load per week of: 6 hours\\nThe minimum technical requirements you need to participate are: e.g.: Internet for Zoom\\n\\nSection 3: Schedule/Timetable of the learning offer\\nStarting: 25/04/2022\\nEnd: 25/07/2022\\nEvaluation period: from 01/07/2022 to 31/07/2022\\nLive sessions:\\nMo: 18:00 - 19:45",

It asks how these places are often simultaneously understood and imagined as Indigenous Country, as the site of colonisation and settler homemaking, or as locations of a modern multicultural nation. The process of narration plays an important role in such understandings and imaginings of places and we will focus on how and why such narratives (in the broadest sense) are constructed and what forms they might take. Starting out from an engagement with the Aboriginal Australian concept of ‘Country’, we will focus on iconic Australian locations such as the outback, the beach, the city, or the border and ask how they are narrated across a range of cultural productions including literature, film and the visual arts.",

It engages the manifold ways in which citizens have responded to migrants and refugees over time – from the Huguenots’ arrival in Brandenburg-Prussia in 1685 to the present – and in various places, including France, Australia, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Germany. The course also examines the responses and visions of migrants and refugees themselves.\\n\\nThe course brings together 30 students from six European universities through the European Digital UniverCity alliance (EDUC), for ten weeks of online learning (starting on April 19, 2022) followed by a week together in Potsdam June 20-25, 2022. In Potsdam students will meet with local decision-makers, civil society and church representatives, and migrants and refugees to learn first-hand about practices and issues relating to migration and integration.\\n\\nTo prepare for this, students will be introduced to theories around integration and will then engage with historic and contemporary case studies that highlight particular issues such as culture, religion, racism, education, and labour in relation to assimilationism and multiculturalism.\\n\\nOverall, the aim of this course is to provide students with the theoretical and conceptual language to make sense of historical processes of refuge-seeking and integration as well as enabling a lively exchange between student perspectives and practitioners’ insights on processes of integration in the city of Potsdam.\\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n- develop an understanding of integration / multiculutralism / assimilation\\n- develop an understading of historic roots of present-day integration challenges\\n- realize the global scale of integration measures\\n- reflect on interconnections between refugee and migration integration\\n- develop critical reading and reflection skills\\n-develop analysis of primary and secondary sources skills\\n- develop teamwork skills\\n-develop oral and written presentation skills\\n- develop intercultural skills\\n-develop transfer skills from historic case studies to present circumstances\\n\\nSection 2: Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is a “blended” one, which means that it is divided in two phases: an Online Program from April 19th to June 14th, 2022 consisting of one lesson every Tuesday from 16:00 to 18:00 h.

It will then look at how Portugal, Spain, Britain and Italy took control of and ruled overseas territories, describe how European domination was resisted and ended, and explain the traces left by colonization and imperialism in the contemporary world. Students will be presented with historical texts and images, and will have to establish logical links between the various cases so as to try and make sense of the different European imperial experiencesbeyond their apparent heterogeneity.",

To avoid the occurrence of such crisis or to reduce its magnitude, it is argued that more regulations are required. Regulations are indeed  tools to shape economic systems. As such, they have tremendous impacts on economic growth and  the well-being of population. \\nIf the content of regulations is to be known when strategies are considered, it is especially crucial  for both lawyers and policy makers to understand the foundations of these regulations. For lawyers,  it helps to develop innovative interpretations and powerful arguments; for policy makers to  understand the consequences and the inherent limits of their actions while also providing tools to  apprehend and criticize existing regulations.  \\nThis course will inquire into the reasons for regulations, the options that are available when a  regulation is considered, their limits and the strategies to deal with them. \\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students with the necessary tools to develop, question and  criticize regulations.",

However,the speedy technological advancement created issues that did not exist in the past –or at least not to such an extent as today. As such the course also involves an in-depth analysis of cybercrime and EU criminal law designed to tackle  it  (among  others  the  European Production  Order  and  the  European  Preservation  Order  will  be introduced in the course). Last,but not least the protection of fundamental rights must be emphasised since EU criminal law is a policy area which greatly affects the freedom of EU citizens (in this context the principle of mutual trust, the ne bis in idem principleand the practice of the Court of Justice of the European Union shall be presented).\\nTimetable: From 10 February - on Thursdays at 14:00\\n \\n\\n\\n",

These signs are produced by different actors and also carry out different functions. Linguistic Landscape (LL) research investigates the distribution of monolingual and multilingual signs in the public sphere, their linguistic and semiotic features, as well as their functions and evolution over time. In doing so, it aims to provide insights into the status of historic and migration-related minority languages in a specific territory.\\n\\nIn this **web-based training**, students will be introduced to the main theoretical approaches and empirical methods for mapping linguistic diversity in public spaces. Particular attention is dedicated to an overview of the current state of LL research in three EDUC areas, that is, Brandenburg and Berlin, Brno and Czech Republic, Cagliari and Sardinia. \\n\\nAt the end of the web-based training, participants will:\\n* be able to describe the complex present and past sociolinguistic situations in Berlin and Brandenburg, Brno and Prague, Cagliari and Sardinia.\\n* become familiar with the current state of research on LLs in these three areas and develop awareness about the distribution of LL signs in their own territory.\\n* be able to discuss advantages and disadvantages of some theoretical-methodological approaches concerning data collection and analysis in LL.\\n* be able to analyze monolingual and multilingual LL signs, describe their functions and link their features to the status of different minority languages and the language ideologies toward them in a given territory.\\n* be able to evaluate and defend responses to a range of linguistic landscape issues.    \\n\\n",

Such an equation provides a description of the infinitesimal increment of the path y in terms of the infinitesimal increment of a driving signal h. Usual ordinary differential equations correspond to h(t) = t, but numerous situations require that we consider non-smooth signal that may not be differentiable, like in stochastic differential equations,where h is a Brownian trajectory. \\nWhat is then the meaning of the above equation? Rough path theory provides an optimal setting for such question, and has applications to controlled deterministic and stochastic systems, noisy PDEs or machine learning! Two thirds of the lectures will deal with the purely analytic side of the story, so the students from the Analysis pathway are most welcome to attend the course. \\n\\n> Live sessions on Zoom:\\nFrom 11/01/2022 to 25/02/2022 \\n       - Tuesday 16h15-18h15 \\n       - Friday 16h15-18h15 \\n \\n> Replays available on EDUC Moodle:\\nFrom 17/01/2022 to 29/04/2022\\n  \\n2. \"\"Introduction to Toric Geometry\"\" by Carl Tipler (Rennes 1 University)\\n\\nIn this class, we will study complex varieties endoxed with a complex (multiplicative) torus action, with a dense and open torus orbit. We will give the combinatorial description of these varieties in terms of fans. This will provide a link between algebraic geometry and convex geometry. We will then describe some of the properties of these varieties, such as completeness and smoothness, in terms of their fans. We will apply these descriptions in dimension two, give the classification of complete smooth toric surfaces and study toric surface singularities and their resolutions.\\n\\n> Live sessions on Zoom:\\nFrom 11/01/2022 to 02/02/2022   \\n       - Tuesday 14h-17h \\n       - Wednesday 8h-11h \\n\\n> Replays available on EDUC Moodle:\\nFrom 17/01/2022 to 29/04/2022\\n\\n3.\"\"Computational Topology\"\" by Myfanwy Evans (University of Potsdam)\\n\\nBased on “Computational Topology: An Introduction\"\", by Herbert Edelsbrunner and John Harer.\\nThis course will give an introduction to the field of computational topology. It will start with motivating problems in both mathematics and computer science followed by classic topics in geometric and algebraic topology, and ending with the concept of persistent homology. The course provides an introduction to a topic which transforms a mostly theoretical field of mathematics into one that is relevant to a multitude of disciplines in the sciences and engineering. The course will be based on the book: H. Edelsbrunner and J. Harer. Computational Topology. An Introduction. Amer. Math. Soc. 2010. \\n\\n> Starting date : mid-April \\n> Duration : 6 weeks\\n> Replays available on EDUC Moodle\\n\\n4. \"\"An introduction to Gibbs measures in Statistical Mechanics\"\" by Sylvie Roelly (University of Potsdam)\\n\\nInspired by the book from Friedli and Velenik, we aim to present a mathematical introduction to Gibbsian lattice systems. We first focus on some of the most important and relevant examples,  the Ising model, and introduce in that framework the concepts of magnetization, infinite volume system (or thermodynamic limit), phase transition versus uniqueness etc. Several methods (e.g. contour arguments, cluster expansion, regularity of the pressure) will be used to prove the main results.\\n\\n> Starting date : mid-April \\n> Duration : 6 weeks\\n> Replays available on EDUC Moodle",

These two areas are at the core of this years’ EDUC summer school: climate change communication and climate policies.\\n\\nDuring the course, students will learn about the key factors in climate change communication and understand the obstacles that stand in the way of reaching a societal consensus on the risks of climate change and on the policies needed to slow it down. The course will provide students with experience and practical advice regarding climate change communication and advocacy and give them the opportunity to work on climate communication alongside experts. We will focus on effective tools of communication, including the study of narratives in political conflict, the dynamics of public opinion and the role of marketing and labelling approaches. Students will have the opportunity to design their own climate change campaign in teams and consult it with experts.\\n\\nThe focus on policy will include an introduction to the range of climate-related public policies, starting from transnational measures and going all the way to local adaptations and regulations. The students will learn the complex aspects of climate policymaking on the local level and the various strategies that can be used to foster climatic resilience of cities. The teaching will be supplemented by academic site visits and field trips where students can observe the measures in practice and discuss them with experts. In their final project, students will propose policy designs and simulate their implementation as a part of participatory research.",

Consequently, it does neither claim to “cover” the whole level A1 according to the CEFR nor to provide A1 exam training but instead to empower successful participants to take their first steps in a German speaking surrounding and – equally important – to manage their further language acquisition.\\n\\nUpon successfully engaging in this course, learners:\\n- can recognise concrete information (e.g. places and times) on familiar topics encountered in everyday life, provided it is delivered slowly and clearly.\\n- can understand some expressions when people are discussing them: personal and academic life, hobbies or surroundings, provided the delivery is slow and clear.\\n- can understand instructions addressed carefully and slowly to them and follow short, simple directions.\\n- can understand very short, simple texts a single phrase at a time, picking up familiar names, words and basic phrases.\\n- can guess the probable meaning of an unknown word/sign that is similar to one in the language they normally use.\\n- can produce simple, mainly isolated phrases about people, time and places.\\n- can ask and answer simple questions, initiate and respond to simple statements in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.\\n- can make an introduction and use basic greeting and leave-taking expressions.\\n- can ask for food and drink using basic expressions.\\n- can handle numbers, quantities, cost and time (can-do statements according to the CEFR).\\n\\nSection 2: Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nMode: Hybrid – participation in classroom or online via Zoom and Moodle\\n\\nSection 3: Schedule/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nStarting: 21/04/2022\\nEnd: 28/07/2022\\nEvaluation period: from TBD\\nLive sessions:\\nThursdays: 16:15 - 19:30 h\\n",

This illegal market segment operates within an uncontrolled environment, with no restrictions on vendors, consumers or products, in which practically anyone can purchase any type of medication – including counterfeit drugs – without a prescription, medical supervision or appropriate diagnosis, consequently compromising patient and medication safety. International and national authorities lack efficient tools to discover and shut down illicit pharmacy websites and stop the illicit trade of counterfeit medicines. Accordingly, advanced computational methods are needed to detect and mitigate cybercriminal activity, and efficient inter-disciplinary communication and public awareness campaigns to inform consumers.\\nThe course will provide insight into the current issues of the online pharmaceutical market and the dangers of counterfeit medicines. Real world data on legitimate and rogue online pharmacies, various stakeholders, networks, products and information content will be introduced, along with the discussion of measures combating illegal peddling of pharmaceuticals. Novel information technology and data-science methods on the evaluation of this enormous online market will be discussed.\\nStudents can access resources for their individual and group assignment, further the slides of the lectures and further reading material on a designated web based interface.\\n\\nStarting date and finishing of the course: 7th October (Friday) - 2nd December (Friday)\\nSchedule:  synchronous dates: 7th of October (Friday) at 13:00, 4th of November (Friday) at 13:00, 2nd of December (Friday) at 13:00\\n\\nName of teachers: Dr. András Fittler, Dr. Vida Róbert, Dr. Tünde Ambrus, Dr. Tünde Ambrus, Dr. Lenka Smejkalová",

Built on an action-orientated approach and a fully Moodle-based online learning material, it addresses reception, production, interaction and mediation in terms of language activities in connection to language strategies in various, but typical areas of communication related to academic life in Potsdam. Consequently, it does neither claim to “cover” the whole level A1 according to the CEFR nor to provide A1 exam training but instead to empower successful participants to take their first steps in a German speaking surrounding and – equally important – to manage their further language acquisition.\\n\\nUpon successfully engaging in this course, learners:\\n- can recognise concrete information (e.g. places and times) on familiar topics encountered in everyday life, provided it is delivered slowly and clearly.\\n- can understand some expressions when people are discussing them: personal and academic life, hobbies or surroundings, provided the delivery is slow and clear.\\n- can understand instructions addressed carefully and slowly to them and follow short, simple directions.\\n- can understand very short, simple texts a single phrase at a time, picking up familiar names, words and basic phrases.\\n- can guess the probable meaning of an unknown word/sign that is similar to one in the language they normally use.\\n- can produce simple, mainly isolated phrases about people, time and places.\\n- can ask and answer simple questions, initiate and respond to simple statements in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.\\n- can make an introduction and use basic greeting and leave-taking expressions.\\n- can ask for food and drink using basic expressions.\\n- can handle numbers, quantities, cost and time (can-do statements according to the CEFR).\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nMode: online synchronous via Zoom (live sessions) and online asynchronous through Moodle.\\n\\n#### Schedule/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nStarting: 20/10/2022\\nEnd: 09/02/2023\\nEvaluation period: TBD\\nLive sessions:\\n**Thursdays: 16:00 - 20:00 h**\\n",

In the continuity of the Mediterranean city-states, this territorial modality of the civitas gave rise to several urban centres surrounded by their own territories, whose juxtaposition durably structured the Roman Empire. \\nOrganised around a community of citizens who governed it, the populus, the city enjoyed a certain autonomy under the same law. Buildings and monuments were the embodiment of this community and represented urbanitas, the urban way of life.\\n\\n**The course will take place from 1st March to 20th May 2023**\\n\\n**Workload: 72h** - The student&#039;s work will consist of following the weekly exercises without notation.\\n\\n**Final assessment:** The evaluation is a final exam, a written test on the questions developed in the practice exercises.",

Consequently, it does neither claim to “cover” the whole level A1 according to the CEFR nor to provide A1 exam training but instead to empower successful participants to take their first steps in a German speaking surrounding and – equally important – to manage their further language acquisition.\\n\\n\\nUpon successfully engaging in this course, learners:\\n- can recognise concrete information (e.g. places and times) on familiar topics encountered in everyday life, provided it is delivered slowly and clearly.\\n- can understand some expressions when people are discussing them: personal and academic life, hobbies or surroundings, provided the delivery is slow and clear.\\n- can understand instructions addressed carefully and slowly to them and follow short, simple directions.\\n- can understand very short, simple texts a single phrase at a time, picking up familiar names, words and basic phrases.\\n- can guess the probable meaning of an unknown word/sign that is similar to one in the language they normally use.\\n- can produce simple, mainly isolated phrases about people, time and places.\\n- can ask and answer simple questions, initiate and respond to simple statements in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.\\n- can make an introduction and use basic greeting and leave-taking expressions.\\n- can ask for food and drink using basic expressions.\\n- can handle numbers, quantities, cost and time (can-do statements according to the CEFR).\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nMode: online synchronous via Zoom (live sessions) and online asynchronous through Moodle.\\n\\n#### Schedule/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nStarting: 20/04/2023\\nEnd: 27/07/2023\\nEvaluation period: TBD\\nLive sessions:\\n**Thursdays: 16:00 - 20:00 h**\\n",

        "description": "#### Learning objectives\\n\\nThe course is suitable for learners who have never studied German before and who need a rather flexible setting which they can adjust to their own needs and prospects. By engaging in the first three chapters, learners can achieve the necessary competence level to continue learning in the synchronous German A1 course (with weekly Zoom meetings), which is also available for EDUC universities. If you would like to do the synchronous German A1 course, please allow sufficient time to complete this German A1 Starter course beforehand.\\n\\nThe course comprises learning objects related to typical areas of communication and basic needs in a German speaking community.  Learners can explore the material along the steps Understanding (units with language input along with reflexion exercises and linguistic explanations) Training (mainly vocab and grammar exercises), Testing (quizzes about language use) and Broadening the perspective (additional material from the internet). To ensure learners can manage without a tutor, all exercises come with either computer feedback or an answer key. \\n\\nUpon successfully engaging in this course, learners: \\n\\n- can recognise concrete information (e.g. places and times) on familiar topics encountered in everyday life, provided it is delivered slowly and clearly. \\n- can understand some expressions when people are discussing them: personal and academic life, hobbies or surroundings, provided the delivery is slow and clear. \\n- can understand very short, simple texts a single phrase at a time, picking up familiar names, words and basic phrases. \\n- can make an introduction and use basic greeting and leave-taking expressions. \\n- can ask for food and drink using basic expressions. \\n- can handle numbers, quantities, cost and time (can-do statements according to the CEFR). \\n\\n",

Its aim is to provide basic information about the socio-cultural environment in which major cultural and literary events took place. The course is held by three instructors, depending on the topic at hand. The course relies on primary readings and highly recommended reference materials, which are made available online for students.\\nGeneral objectives: students completing this survey course will \\n--have an overview of British literary history from the Middle Ages to the Victorian period, \\n--improve their analytic skills through the exploration of connections between literary texts and their different historical, social and cultural contexts, \\n--be better equipped for the analysis of literary texts in a variety of genres, \\n--learn about the emergence and early history of literary genres popular today, \\n--make a connection between current cultural, medial and literary events and trends, and their literary-historical precedents. \\nShort-term achievements: by attending the lecture course, students will gain information on the best canonical writers, their works, and the historical and cultural contexts of the discussed literary periods. The assessment of the course will be based on a final written exam covering the topics discussed during the sessions as well as the primary readings.\\nLong-term achievements: the course is an essential part of the English Studies BA programme. Teaching literary histories is part of the curricula of English Studies programmes in BA courses in Europe. We plan to reach undergraduate students from the universities participating in the EDUC consortium. The lecture course will contribute to their knowledge of English literary and cultural studies of which this lecture course on British Literature and Culture I is an essential part. \\n\\nTeachers: Dr. Gabriella Hartvig (University of Pécs), Dr. Filip Bul Krajník (Masaryk University Brno), Dr. Csaba Maczelka (University of Pécs)",

        "description": "These asynchronous courses are designed for EDUC students utilizing self-guided activities to prepare them for language exams in English, German, Hungarian and Czech – four of the languages represented in the EDUC network of universities. Students enrolling in the course will have opportunities to practice developing their receptive (reading and listen) and productive (writing and speaking) skills in these four languages, working through typical tasks found on language exams. These courses are built around the European Consortium of Languages (ECL), which is the University of Pecs’ foreign language exam system offering ECUC students and others across the EU and aboard language exam certificates in more than ten languages.\\n\\nThis online language assessment preparation course in Moodle will be structured around six learning modules for the target language and CEFR level: 1.) Introduction to the ECL Language Examination System at the University of Pecs, 2.) Reading section of assessment, 3.) Writing section of assessment, 4.) Listening section of assessment, 5.) Speaking section of assessment, and 6.) Online Practice Exam. In Moodle, participants will work through a series of pre-recorded screen casts of Google Slides and Prezi presentations to learn more about the content they can expect to encounter on the ECL language exam. They will also have access to PDF files, sample language assessments, and additional online resources to assist in preparation. All modules will include asynchronous resources for EDUC staff and students to work through the productive and receptive skills independently and at their own pace. However, the modules will include the following recommend time (Total Time: 6 weeks/22 hours) to spend on each language learning task in order to successfully prepare for a language assessment in the selected EDUC language. \\n\\nTeacher: Peter Sabath (UPE/PTE) https://inyk.pte.hu/munkatarsaink/",

The topic is quite extensive: it involves the traditional issue of transnational organised crime and how to tackle it (as such legal instruments of operative cooperation  of  law  enforcement  and  judicial  authorities  of  EU  Member  States and  the  harmonisation  of substantive criminal law shall be presented as indispensable tools in EU criminal law). However,the speedy technological advancement created issues that did not exist in the past –or at least not to such an extent as today. As such the course also involves an in-depth analysis of cybercrime and EU criminal law designed to tackle  it  (among  others  the  European Production  Order  and  the  European  Preservation  Order  will  be introduced in the course). Last, but not least the protection of fundamental rights must be emphasised since EU criminal law is a policy area which greatly affects the freedom of EU citizens (in this context the principle of mutual trust, the ne bis in idem principleand the practice of the Court of Justice of the European Union shall be presented).\\n\\nTimetable: 17 February – 20 May 2023 - on Thursdays and Fridays 9.00 or 10.00 CET (9.00: 9 March, 16 March; 10.00: 17 February, 23 February, 3 March, 24 March, 31 March, 14 April, 21 April, 28 April, 4 May)",

In this collaborative online international learning (COIL) project between the University of Potsdam and Beit Berl College (Israel),  students listen to and learn from noted speakers in the fields of business, politics, literature, and education. In turn, students share their ideas on these topics by making memorable speeches of their own. We welcome students from the EDUC alliance to participate in some of the sessions (**for no ECTS points**).\\nPlease see &quot;More Info&quot; for the course time, expected outcomes, and requirements .)\\n\\nIn this course students should master oral communication of an informative, explanatory, and persuasive nature through presenting.

Extending the invitation to partake in the workshop to the language centers and students of the EDUC partner universities of the University of Potsdam, Zessko and CLE offer a three-session COIL in which students will get the chance to explore their own definition of culture, reflect on their own language and cultural background, practice communicating in English, and become acquainted with the new cultures and stories from their fellow participants. These themes will be mediated in story-telling and predominantly oral activities. In this virtual learning setting, students enhance their language proficiency in English as well as their intercultural communicative competence and are asked 1) to  embrace the opportunities that come with experiencing cultural diversity and 2) to then answer the overarching core question of this workshop about one’s own cultural identity; 3) to respect individual difference and shared global values, and 4) to ultimately rise to the EDUC’s mission statement of creating an inclusive and diverse digital space for intercultural exchange and discourse.\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is **virtual**, and **synchronous**.\\n\\nPlease consider a total work-load of: 4.5 hours (participation EDUC Certificate)\\n\\n#### Schedule/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nNumber of hours: **1.5 h per session**\\n\\nSessions on: 06/11/2023, 20/11/202320 and 04/12/2023\\n\\n|      Time     \\t| Mo \\t| Tu \\t| We \\t| Th \\t| Fr \\t|\\n|:-------------:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|\\n| 10:00 - 11:30 \\t|  x  \\t|   \\t|    \\t|    \\t|    \\t|\\n\\n",

Since 2020, it has brought together about 300  B.A. English and B.Ed. English students from the University of Potsdam and Beit Berl College (Israel) and provides these students with opportunities to experience virtual collaboration. The course instructors in Germany and Israel (originally from the USA, South Africa, and Great Britain) focus on improving students’ oral proficiency in English (accuracy, fluency, pronunciation), and participants have been able to attain a high proficiency in the main communicative language competences as outlined in the CEFR.\\nWhat is more, INTERFACE presents a form of didactic modeling, which is especially important for future educators. Student participants are encouraged to take an active role in this online project and thus have have a degree of autonomy  (cf. UP Mission Statement for Teaching and Learning, “4. Target group-specific teaching”). They can select which digital tools work best for them, reflect on alternative assessment models (tasks and rubrics), and decide what constitutes authentic learning and a safe online learning environment. In doing so, they grow to understand the importance of collaboration and innovation. By working in English with speakers of Arabic, Hebrew, German, and other languages, the students question their ideas of the “Other” and grow to embrace diversity.  Furthermore, the project also prepares the students with skills for life and the workforce, such as flexibility and adaptability, social and cross-cultural skills, and accountability and responsibility (cf. UP Mission Statement for Teaching and Learning, “2. Career orientation and personal development”). \\n**We welcome students in the EDUC alliance to participate in some of the sessions (for no ECTS points) or for all of the sessions (an EDUC certificate stating 90 hours as workload, equivalent to 3 ECTS).** In both cases, students will be issued an EDUC certificate. **Passive participants will be removed from the Moodle course.** \\n\\nUpon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:\\n\\n- recognize and practice appropriate articulation of English phonemes\\n- raise awareness of and practise the suprasegmental features of English, including stress and intonation patterns, as well as connected speech\\n- learn how to identify interference from one’s native language and develop skills for speaking intelligibly\\n- recognize and comprehend a variety of accents to navigate different communicative contexts\\n- discuss relevant topics with the goal of engaging in meaningful discourse in different contexts (e.g. presentations and interviews)\\n- gain insight into the interconnection between pronunciation and non-verbal behaviour in conveying and interpreting meaning, particularly when giving academic presentations.\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is **synchronous**\\n\\n#### Schedule/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nStarting: 16/10/2023\\nEnd: 09/02/2024\\nTuesdays from 14:00 to 16:00 h\\n\\n|      Time     \\t| Mo \\t| Tu \\t| We \\t| Th \\t| Fr \\t|\\n|:-------------:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|\\n| 14:00 - 16:00|    \\t|  x \\t|    \\t|    \\t|    \\t|\\n",

Consequently, it does neither claim to “cover” the whole level A1 according to the CEFR nor to provide A1 exam training but instead to empower successful participants to take their first steps in a German speaking surrounding and – equally important – to manage their further language acquisition.\\n\\nUpon successfully engaging in this course, learners:\\n- can recognise concrete information (e.g. places and times) on familiar topics encountered in everyday life, provided it is delivered slowly and clearly.\\n- can understand some expressions when people are discussing them: personal and academic life, hobbies or surroundings, provided the delivery is slow and clear.\\n- can understand instructions addressed carefully and slowly to them and follow short, simple directions.\\n- can understand very short, simple texts a single phrase at a time, picking up familiar names, words and basic phrases.\\n- can guess the probable meaning of an unknown word/sign that is similar to one in the language they normally use.\\n- can produce simple, mainly isolated phrases about people, time and places.\\n- can ask and answer simple questions, initiate and respond to simple statements in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.\\n- can make an introduction and use basic greeting and leave-taking expressions.\\n- can ask for food and drink using basic expressions.\\n- can handle numbers, quantities, cost and time (can-do statements according to the CEFR).\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nMode: Flipped classroom with asynchronous individual learning through Moodle (instruction, exercises and quizzes, assignments) + regular video meetings via Zoom (collaborative task-based learning) according to participants’ progress with the individual learning (admission to meetings may be linked to the assignments).\\n\\n**Workload: 180 h (*equivalent to 6 ECTS)**\\n\\n#### Schedule/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nStarting: 19/10/2023\\nEnd: 09/02/2024\\nExam: most likely 8th February 2024\\nLive sessions:\\n**Thursdays: 16:00 - 19:30 h, weekly**\\n",

        "description": " \\n#### Learning objectives\\n\\nThe Seminar will deal with questions of the inter-relation of the spatial category of islands with intellectual phenomena linked to the Enlightenment with regard to different dimensions:\\n- Island Literatures of the 18th Century and beyond: the Early Modern Genre of Island Utopias is continued and transformed in the 18th Century and forms a wide-spread genre in the different European contexts (beginning with Daniel Defoe’s “Robinson Crusoe” and its European reception in works such as J.G. Schnabels “Insel Felsenburg” leading to Denis Diderots “Supplement au voyage de Bougainville” in France or Wilhelm Heinses “Glückselige Inseln” in Germany). Connected to this are crucial discourses of the Enlightenment on social and economic reforms, questions of colonialism and Euro-centrism etc.\\n- Political significance of Islands and the Haitian Revolution: in the (colonial) system of World Powers islands played a crucial role. The Haitian Revolution of 1790ff. is the major event which inspired questions on the relation of Enlightenment and colonialism until today.\\n- In the philosophical discourses of the Enlightenment the “island” understood in a broader metaphorical sense is a central motive on different levels (epistemology, political philosophy, social philosophy, economy etc.) These are ranging from indigene cartographies from the Pacifics up to the methodological individualism in Adam Smith’ “The Wealth of Nations”.\\nThe aim of the Summer School is to bring together the various research clusters at the EDUC partner universities. At least at the universities of Potsdam, Cagliari, and Paris Nanterre there are existing internationally visible research foci related to the topic which promise fruitful synergies and we invite further EDUC partner universities to participate.\\n\\nThree main topics have been defined so far:\\n1. Island Literatures\\nThe participants will learn about European literatures of the 18th Century and the crucial position of islands for the development of Enlightenment&#039;s genres (from Daniel Defoe&#039;s Robinson Crusoe on).\\n\\n2. Island Epistemologies\\nThe participants will learn to reflect the role of islands (as a topographical concept as well as in a metaphorical sense) for epistemological models of the Enlightenment (from Bacon&#039;s Nova Atlantis to Adam Smith&#039;s methodological individualism)\\n\\n3. Island Politics: The participants will learn about the role of Islands in the colonial system of the 18th Century and their significance as contact zone of European and extra-European cultures in the development of key concepts of the Enlightenment (like in Diderot&#039;s writings on Tahiti or in the Haitian Enlightenment)\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario:\\n\\nThis learning offer is a blended research summer school, which means eight weeks of online learning with one live session per week plus one week of on site-program at the university of Potsdam.\\n\\nPlease consider a total workload of: 90 hours.\\n\\nThe minimum technical requirements you need to participate are: e.g.: Zoom account.\\n\\n#### Schedule/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\n##### Virtual phase:\\n- Starting: 6 May 2024\\n- End: 24 June 2024\\n- One online session per week (Mondays from 4-6 p.m)*\\n\\n|      Time     \\t| Mo \\t| Tu \\t| We \\t| Th \\t| Fr \\t|\\n|:-------------:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|:--:\\t|\\n| 16:00 - 18:00 \\t|   X\\t|   \\t|    \\t|    \\t|    \\t|\\n\\n##### On site-week\\n- Dates: From 1 to 5 July, 2024\\n- Schedule: Mo-Fr: 10:00-18:00\\n[🗎 First draft of on site-program](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/fileadmin/projects/educ/F%C3%BCr_Studierende/Summer_Schools/EDUC_blended_research_summer_school_Islands_of_the_Enlightenment_preliminary_programme_U_Potsdam.pdf)\\n\\n#### Application &amp; Scholarships:\\nStudents in this program receive an EDUC scholarship from their home university to finance their participation in the on site week.

But was the situation so simple? Who were these “barbarians”? And did the Empire really collapse or was it rather transformed? The goal of this course is to focus on the artistic, visual, material, and performative cultures that coexisted in this extraordinary moment of history. To reach this objective, we will firstly focus on the prejudices constructed from the Renaissance to our days about what was commonly considered as the “Dark Ages”. Secondly, we will be investigating the role of medias in the transformations of visual history: from sculptures to “bidimensional” images, from roll to codex, from the illusive image to the iconic one. Third, we will analyze the role played by the meeting of cultures – constitutive for the investigated period – in the birth of the “Middle Ages”.\\n\\nThis course is taught by the Department of Art History at Masaryk University. \\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n- be able to orientate himself in the visual and material cultures of the Late Antique to Early Medieval world;\\n- understand the tools and the importance of visual culture within social and historical phenomena;\\n- fall in love with art history!\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is **asynchronous**, which means that this is an e-learning course (e-learning materials + final essay).\\n\\nPlease consider a workload per the whole course of 125 hours (25 hours/1 ECTS).",

Consequently, it does neither claim to “cover” the whole level A1 according to the CEFR nor to provide A1 exam training. Instead, it is to empower successful participants to take their first steps in a German speaking surrounding and – equally important – to manage their further language acquisition.\\n\\nUpon successfully engaging in this course, learners:\\n- can recognise concrete information (e.g., places and times) on familiar topics encountered in everyday life, provided it is delivered slowly and clearly.\\n- can understand some expressions when people are discussing them: personal and academic life, hobbies or surroundings, provided the delivery is slow and clear.\\n- can understand instructions addressed carefully and slowly to them and follow short, simple directions.\\n- can understand very short, simple texts a single phrase at a time, picking up familiar names, words and basic phrases.\\n- can guess the probable meaning of an unknown word/sign that is similar to one in the language they normally use.\\n- can produce simple, mainly isolated phrases about people, time and places.\\n- can ask and answer simple questions, initiate and respond to simple statements in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.\\n- can make an introduction and use basic greeting and leave-taking expressions.\\n- can ask for food and drink using basic expressions.\\n- can handle numbers, quantities, cost and time (can-do statements according to the CEFR).\\n\\n#### Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nMode: Regular video meetings via Zoom (language learning discussions, collaborative task-based learning) connected with asynchronous individual learning through Moodle (learning videos, exercises and quizzes, assignments).\\n\\n**Workload: 180 h (*equivalent to 6 ECTS)**\\n\\n#### Schedule/Timetable of the learning offer\\n\\nStarting: 08/04/2024\\nEnd: 19/07/2024\\n\\nExam: most likely mid-July 2024\\n\\nWeekly video meetings (Zoom):\\n**presumably Thursdays: weekly, 16:00 - 19:30 h (to be confirmed)**\\n\\n### Certificate\\nCertificate of attendance, Zessko&#039;s A1 certificate upon passing the A1 exam, digital documents will be made available via Moodle.",

These courses are built around the European Consortium of Languages (ECL), which is the University of Pecs’ foreign language exam system offering ECUC students and others across the EU and aboard language exam certificates in more than ten languages.\\n\\nThis online language assessment preparation course in Moodle will be structured around six learning modules for the target language and CEFR level: 1.) Introduction to the ECL Language Examination System at the University of Pecs, 2.) Reading section of assessment, 3.) Writing section of assessment, 4.) Listening section of assessment, 5.) Speaking section of assessment, and 6.) Online Practice Exam. In Moodle, participants will work through a series of pre-recorded screen casts of Google Slides and Prezi presentations to learn more about the content they can expect to encounter on the ECL language exam. They will also have access to PDF files, sample language assessments, and additional online resources to assist in preparation. All modules will include asynchronous resources for EDUC staff and students to work through the productive and receptive skills independently and at their own pace.

        "description": "Section 1: Learning objectives\\n\\nThis intensive blended course delves into the global history of processes of refuge-seeking: it explores the many challenges that refugees and migrants face and the opportunities they create in receiving countries. It engages the manifold ways in which citizens have responded to migrants and refugees over time – from the Huguenots’ arrival in Brandenburg-Prussia in 1685 to the present – and in various places, including France, Australia, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Germany. The course also examines the responses and visions of migrants and refugees themselves.\\n\\nThe course brings together 30 students from six European universities through the European Digital UniverCity alliance (EDUC), for ten weeks of online learning (starting on April 17, 2022) followed by a week together in Potsdam June 24-29, 2024. In Potsdam students will meet with local decision-makers, civil society and church representatives, and migrants and refugees to learn first-hand about practices and issues relating to migration and integration.\\n\\nTo prepare for this, students will be introduced to theories around integration and will then engage with historic and contemporary case studies that highlight particular issues such as culture, religion, racism, education, and labour in relation to assimilationism and multiculturalism.\\n\\nOverall, the aim of this course is to provide students with the theoretical and conceptual language to make sense of historical processes of refuge-seeking and integration as well as enabling a lively exchange between student perspectives and practitioners’ insights on processes of integration in the city of Potsdam.\\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n- develop an understanding of integration / multiculturalism / assimilation\\n- develop an understanding of historic roots of present-day integration challenges\\n- realize the global scale of integration measures\\n- reflect on interconnections between refugee and migration integration\\n- develop critical reading and reflection skills\\n-develop analysis of primary and secondary sources skills\\n- develop teamwork skills\\n-develop oral and written presentation skills\\n- develop intercultural skills\\n-develop transfer skills from historic case studies to present circumstances\\n\\nSection 2: Details of the learning scenario\\n\\nThis learning offer is a “blended” one, which means that it is divided in two phases: an Online Program from April 19th to June 14th, 2022 consisting of one lesson every Tuesday from 16:00 to 18:00 h.

Extending the invitation to partake in the workshop to the language centers and students of the EDUC partner universities of the University of Potsdam, Zessko and CLE offer a three-session COIL in which students will get the chance to explore their own definition of culture, reflect on their own language and cultural background, practice communicating in English, and become acquainted with the new cultures and stories from their fellow participants.

But was the situation so simple? Who were these “barbarians”? And did the Empire really collapse or was it rather transformed? The goal of this course is to focus on the artistic, visual, material, and performative cultures that coexisted in this extraordinary moment of history. To reach this objective, we will firstly focus on the prejudices constructed from the Renaissance to our days about what was commonly considered as the “Dark Ages”. Secondly, we will be investigating the role of medias in the transformations of visual history: from sculptures to “bidimensional” images, from roll to codex, from the illusive image to the iconic one. Third, we will analyze the role played by the meeting of cultures – constitutive for the investigated period – in the birth of the “Middle Ages”.\\n\\nThis course is taught by the Department of Art History at Masaryk University. \\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n- be able to orientate himself in the visual and material cultures of the Late Antique to Early Medieval world;\\n- understand the tools and the importance of visual culture within social and historical phenomena;\\n- fall in love with art history!",

Its aim is to raise doctoral students&#039; awareness by outlining the main issues and concepts.\\n\\nDescription\\nMorning programme:\\n- Introduction to research ethics and scientific integrity led by Mathieu Rouault, Grand Labo science journalist.\\n- Lecture on legal and moral ethics by Jean-Marcel PIRIOU, research engineer at the CNRM (Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques), CNRS / Météo-France.\\nHe provides training in ‘ethics and scientific integrity’ for doctoral students at the Toulouse Doctoral School. In 2012, he published the book ‘Happiness here and now’, which looks at the link between ethics, law and morality, and other notions of general philosophy. The lecture will be followed by a 30-minute discussion.\\nPresentation\\nIn the first part, he will give examples of ethical, societal or research problems (debates on animal experimentation, localisation and 5G, plagiarism in research, tensions over co-authorship or the anteriority of results, the societal role of whistleblowers, etc.). He will then document the links and differences between ethics, law and morality: definitions, examples. He will discuss their causal links, and how ethical reflection drives the development of laws and morals. It will look at ethics in history. And he will give examples of ethical dilemmas in research, which will be an opportunity to present a central method in ethical reflection: identifying the values at stake, then sorting them out, and stressing the importance of an open and consensual debate on them (ethics committees). He will use examples to illustrate the link between values and virtues. He will also review scientific truth and its link with the ethical approach. He will define scientific ethics and integrity, and give examples. The final session will focus on the link between ethics and self-confidence, and how the ethical approach is liberating.\\n- Round table: Ethics and scientific integrity officer in higher education establishments: role and missions\\nThe issues of scientific ethics and integrity are becoming increasingly important in the conduct of research, as well as in the publication of research results and the promotion of research. This concern must therefore emerge right from the research training that constitutes doctoral studies. In addition to the major ethical principles that prohibit plagiarism and the publication of fraudulent results, ethical issues arise throughout the research process, in the day-to-day work of the researcher, with the collection and use of data. This varies from one scientific discipline to another, but they are all involved in one way or another: protection of individuals, protection of digital data, animal rights and environmental protection, etc. In addition to the vigilance that researchers must maintain in their practice, they may also need to obtain authorisations from bodies dedicated to these aspects, which will be discussed in the course of this half-day training session.",

In addition, stricter regulations and the challenges of social responsibility mean that the fundamental principles of scientific integrity must be understood and embraced.\\nFrance&#039;s various research organizations have stepped up their initiatives, and their convergence led to the signing of the Charter of Ethics for Research Professions by France Universités (Association of Universities and Higher Education and Research Establishments) and the main organizations in January 2015. Following the report submitted by Prof. Pierre Corvol in 2016, &quot;Bilan et propositions de mise en œuvre de la charte nationale d&#039;intégrité scientifique&quot;, several decisions were taken, including :\\n\\n- doctoral schools must ensure that doctoral students receive training in ethics and scientific integrity,\\n- establishments have appointed a scientific integrity referent,\\n- a French Office of Scientific Integrity (OFIS) was set up in 2017 within the Haut Conseil de l&#039;évaluation de la recherche et de l&#039;enseignement supérieur (Hcéres). \\n\\nThis mobilization was reinforced at the end of 2021 by the publication of a legislative decree on compliance with scientific integrity requirements by public establishments and foundations contributing to the public research service. This text introduces into the law a definition of scientific integrity and the obligation for establishments to ensure the awareness and training of their staff and students in respecting the requirements of scientific integrity.\\n\\nCommitted to this issue since 2012 with the adoption of a charter, the University of Bordeaux has, in partnership with the CPU, COMETS-CNRS, INSERM and INRA, developed the training course on scientific integrity that we are offering you.",

However, they find it harder to get a job, are more likely to find themselves in precarious situations, are often paid less and have fewer opportunities for promotion, including in academia. For example, the salary of a male manager is five times higher than it was at the start of his career, while that of a female manager is only 2.7 times higher (INSEE 2010). This situation can be explained by a number of factors: the burden of domestic tasks and bringing up children, lower professional ambitions, male solidarity, less assertiveness, dedication to the company without sufficient recognition of the work done, etc.\\n\\nThe aims of this course are:\\n\\n-  to help doctoral students identify the various factors that can limit their ability to advance and to give them the means to avoid having to put up with a situation,\\n- examine the impact of male domination at university and how it relates to other forms of discrimination,\\n- learn about policies to promote gender equality at university and their possible limitation\\n\\nCourse description\\n1.  Exposure of socio-historical obstacles (in particular the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; that women still encounter in their professional careers, including in academia, and the illusion of equality already there and its confusion with gender diversity),\\n\\n2.

Since 2020, it has brought together about 300  B.A. English and B.Ed. English students from the University of Potsdam and Beit Berl College (Israel) and provides these students with opportunities to experience virtual collaboration. The course instructors in Germany and Israel (originally from the USA, South Africa, and Great Britain) focus on improving students’ oral proficiency in English (accuracy, fluency, pronunciation), and participants have been able to attain a high proficiency in the main communicative language competences as outlined in the CEFR.\\nWhat is more, INTERFACE presents a form of didactic modeling, which is especially important for future educators. Student participants are encouraged to take an active role in this online project and thus have have a degree of autonomy (cf. UP Mission Statement for Teaching and Learning, “4. Target group-specific teaching”). They can select which digital tools work best for them, reflect on alternative assessment models (tasks and rubrics), and decide what constitutes authentic learning and a safe online learning environment. In doing so, they grow to understand the importance of collaboration and innovation. By working in English with speakers of Arabic, Hebrew, German, and other languages, the students question their ideas of the “Other” and grow to embrace diversity.  Furthermore, the project also prepares the students with skills for life and the workforce, such as flexibility and adaptability, social and cross-cultural skills, and accountability and responsibility (cf. UP Mission Statement for Teaching and Learning, “2. Career orientation and personal development”). \\n**We welcome students in the EDUC alliance to participate in some of the sessions (for no ECTS points) or for all of the sessions (for an EDUC certificate stating 90 hours as workload, equivalent to 3 ECTS).** In both cases, students will be issued an EDUC certificate. **Passive participants will be removed from the Moodle course.** \\nPlease see &quot;More Info&quot; for the course time, expected outcomes, and requirements.",

        "description": "**Duration of the internship**\\n3 to 6 months\\n\\n**Hours per week**\\n24 to 35 hours\\n\\n**Preferred start date**\\nNo constraints \\n\\n**Preferred end date**\\nNo constraints \\n\\n**Further information about host organisation and relevant links**\\nThe International Affairs Department of the University of Rennes is made of an international team of 23 administrative staff. The Department is located in a modern and central building in the city of Rennes. Rennes is the capital city of the Brittany Region, in the west part of France. Just 1.5h by train from Paris and 1h from the seaside. Rennes is a vibrant city, with plenty of sports and cultural activities to do.\\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\n**Context**: Nowadays, Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can accurately perform many tasks, such as language processing, image and video classification, audio and radar processing, and instance segmentation [1 - 3]. Recently, large AI applications such as OpenAI GPT-4, Meta LLaMA3, and Mistral Mixture of Experts have captivated public interest with their high accuracy. Those applications demonstrated a high accuracy not only in one specific task but also performed well when processing multimodal data (e.g., a combination of text and images). Recent AI algorithms have also shown outstanding performance in space exploration, as they can process data locally in the satellites and send only useful information to Earth, avoiding unnecessary communication [4, 5]. \\n\\nDue to their resource-intensive nature, AI programs need dedicated hardware accelerators, such as graphics and tensor processing units, to be employed in any application, including space satellites. Unfortunately, the hardware resources necessary to execute current state-of-the-art AI software are highly vulnerable to radiation-induced errors present on space missions. The errors caused by ionizing particles in space can modify the hardware operations and propagate through the software, leading to failures in AI systems. \\n\\nThis research aims to characterize the error rate of AI codes for space exploration. We plan to characterize the impact of faults on AI algorithms with fault injection and propose efficient fault tolerance methods.  \\n\\n**Work proposal**: The student will conduct fault simulation on AI-based systems to simulate faults caused by space radiation. The experiments will be conducted on a Microchip PolarFire System on Chip development board, with various AI algorithms in operation. Following the simulations, we will assess how the faults affect the operating system and the AI algorithms. We can then propose algorithm-level fault tolerance to mitigate system failures resulting from radiation-induced faults. Depending on the project schedule and progress, we may be able to perform accelerated radiation experiments to evaluate the error rate and fault tolerance. \\n\\nRequired skills: \\n- Advanced Computer architecture knowledge \\n- C/C++ programming \\n- Python Programming \\n- Advanced knowledge of embedded systems \\n- Basics of AI and machine learning \\n- Knowledge of hardware description languages is a plus. \\n\\n*References* : \\n\\n[1] Xiaohua  Zhai et al., Scaling Vision Transformers, IEEE/CVF CVPR, 2022 \\n[2] Chong Chen, et al., Compound fault diagnosis for industrial robots based on dual-transformer networks, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 2023 \\n[3] Yuxin Fang, et al., EVA-02: A Visual Representation for Neon Genesis, CVPR 2023 \\n[4] Jakubik, J. et al., HLS Foundantion, https://github.com/nasa-impact/hls-foundation-os \\n[5] M.

This macroscopic phenomenon is governed at the microscale by capillary flows along water films between the top of the soil and the water at depth. The stability of these films is crucial to have an effective drying and it is highly sensitive to the physico-chemistry of the soil such as the surface tension at air-water interfaces or the contact angle of the aqueous phase with grains [1].  \\n\\nIn soil, bacteria abound, with ~ 1010 bacteria per gram of top soil. Many of them release surface active components – surfactants – in their surroundings which can strongly decrease the surface tension at air-water interfaces and change the contact angle [2]. To date, however, little is known about the potential impact of these bacteria on drying dynamics. How do surfactants accumulate at drying interfaces? Does bacterial behavior, in particular motility by swimming, modify this accumulation dynamics? What are the consequences on the interface behavior inside the soil pores? \\n\\nWe started investigating these questions at the level of the single pore with the PhD project of Nathan Chapelle. We have already started developing an original experimental setup to follow the deformation of a single air-water interface which is put under evaporative forcing in the presence of surfactants, and validated our choice of model bacteria, B.subtilis. The goal of this internship is to get familiar with this setup and to shed light on the role of different bacteria phenotypes (in particular motile vs non-motile) on the repartition of bacteria and surfactants in the bulk and at this air-water interface. To do so, the intern will use microfluidic chips to mimic one pore of the soil, with an air-water interface present. Using optical microscopy techniques, he will track individual bacteria and characterize their behavior during evaporation from the interface. These results will be linked to changes in interface dynamics.  \\n\\nThe intern will be trained in and perform microfabrication by photolithography for microfluidics, microscopic imaging and image processing, particule tracking algorithms to follow individual bacteria as well as standard microbiological culture techniques. \\n\\n*References*: \\n\\n[1] D.

The research center in Rennes is shared with the University of Rennes and other engineering schools, for a total of &gt;700 persons covering most fields of CS. https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university  \\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\nReconstructing a dynamic system from its trajectories is an old topic, addressed by several communities. This is called system identification in systems theory, equation discovery in physics, and automata learning in computer science. In CS, one may wish to recover an automaton from words of its language and possibly from counter-examples. Classical “exact” algorithms exist to do so, as the celebrated L-star by D. Angluin, but the latter relies on powerful oracles, i.e. on the possibility to make queries about some words. More recently, new approaches based on artificial neural networks architectures have reached impressive performances on this problem. Beyond performance, they are appealing by several aspects : they are passive methods, relying simply on data-bases of examples (no queries, no need for powerful oracles), they generalize extremely well and can be used as generators, and, focusing on Large Language Models LM, they manage to capture global text features that go beyond classical regularity - spelling, grammar, syntax - as for example style or even meaning. Last but not least, such approximate methods are poorly understood by computer scientists, and proving their reliability remains an issue.  \\n \\nThe objective of this internship is to explore the way various NN-based architectures manage to approximate a regular language, produced by some hidden automaton. The focus will be on the way the notion of discrete state emerges in these continuous space systems, and how reliable they are as approximators of automata. Several research directions are envisioned, that will be adapted to the skills and wishes of the candidate. We mention some of them below.  \\n\\n- Exploring the approximation abilities of recurrent neural networks (RNN). RNNs are good ap- proximators of regular languages, but tend to build quasi discrete approximations resembling local automata. This property has to be further understood by examining how well RNN learn more complex languages, and by measuring the distance between the original language and the one ap- proximated by the RNN. This is both an experimental and a theoretical direction, as no algorithms yet exist to estimate such distances.  \\n\\n- Exploring the robustness of the models learnt by RNN, to identify stable regions of their state space and unstable ones. The effect of extra data on such robustness also has to be characterized.  \\n\\n- Replacing a true automaton by its RNN surrogate (used as a generative model for example) raises questions like its reliability. One would like to verify properties of runs produced by such soft automata, for example safety properties. Few algorithms yet exist for model checking such models, and they mostly focus on static feed-forward NN, not recurrent ones.  \\n\\n- Exploring the properties of other architectures. While RNN have a vanishing memory, other structures like GRU or LSTM provide longer term memory. The approximation abilities of such models have to be better understood, in particular to characterize the family of languages they best suit.  \\n\\nThe ideal candidate should have a taste for formal methods and abilities for experimental work using standard machine learning libraries.  \\n\\nSee more details here https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Eric.Fabre/Master%202%20internship%202024.pdf\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed** \\n- Autonomy\\n- Problem solving\\n- Synthesis of scientific documents\\n- Programming skills (mostly Python + ML libraries) \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\nhttps://cmi.univ-rennes.fr/en/housing\\nAccess to sports facilities on campus \\nHelp to find an accomodation in Rennes or on the campus \\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\nPossible financial support for 1 trip\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nAt least 2 meeting per week with the supervisors.\\nAdditional meetings if needed. \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\nThis 6 months research internship is oriented to MsC students in Computer Science, as part of their fulfilments for graduation. \\nGood students might be offered a PhD track on a related topic (funding secured) \\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n- Formal science  /  Computer science \\n\\n- Formal science  /  Mathematics \\n\\n- Applied science  /  Engineering and technology \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nMaster level 2\\n",

Such systems are prone to stability\\nloss due to communication delays and specific features of the teleoperated environment.\\nTime-domain control approaches that leverage passivity theory have proven a flexible and successful tool in designing stabilizing control strategies that do not rely on the knowledge of a model of the environment. In such methods, however, the stability guarantee comes in general at the cost of a reduction of the level of transparency, i.e., of the degree of fidelity in force rendering at both the local and the remote side. Recent research has shown that some degrees of freedom in the design process can be exploited to improve the transparency of a given task under the stability constraint.\\n\\nThe objective of this research work is to design and evaluate novel time-domain stabilizing control strategies for multidimensional multi-user teleoperation systems aimed at the maximization of the level of transparency by means of online optimization.\\n\\nThe work will address the following points, tuned according on the expertise and interests\\nof the student:\\n-\\tTheoretical development and simulation of transparency-preserving control strategies based on convex optimization.\\n-\\tSoftware development for real-time implementation of the designed methods on real-world teleoperation systems.\\n-\\tExperimental evaluation and comparison of the performance of the developed control strategies.

This sharing of control allows the human operator to benefit from the support of the autonomous system while retaining a certain degree of control over the robot. The autonomous controller can assist the human user by regulating the robot&#039;s movements to follow the operator&#039;s commands and\\nby performing autonomous actions to optimize the robot&#039;s trajectory and task execution more efficiently. Shared control is particularly useful in complex tasks that require high precision or are performed in challenging or dangerous environments. The resulting motion of the robot is a combination of the user&#039;s input and the action of the\\nautonomous controller, which is the result of one or more cost functions defined based on the task to be performed, such as maximizing the distance from workspace boundaries or minimizing the energy required by the robot. In these cases, haptic feedback can be highly beneficial in informing the human user about the actions of the autonomous controller [Abi- Farraj, Firas, et al., 2019; Selvaggio, Mario, et al., 2021]. Haptic feedback provides a deeper understanding of the actions taken by the autonomous controller, thereby enhancing the operator&#039;s trust in the decisions made by the autonomous system and enabling smoother collaboration between humans and machines. This synergy between the human operator and the autonomous controller improves the overall efficiency of robotic teleoperation and leads to more satisfactory outcomes in task accomplishment. Indeed, shared control enables to combine the precision of autonomous robotic systems with the cognitive capabilities of human operators. However, it may be challenging to define\\nhow to best share the control of the robotic system in a way that is applicable to different users, tasks, and environments.\\n\\nOur objective is to devise a shared-control approach, which adapts, relying also on haptic feedback, the allocation of control authority at run-time, according to the current confidence of the autonomous controller and performance of the user. This division is enforced through an input-mixing shared-control method, where the inputs from the automation and the human operator are weighted according to our authority distribution. At the current stage, the proposed technique is validated in a robotic cutting task: the users receive haptic feedback to inform them of the authority distribution in addition to the cutting constraints and the contact forces.\\n\\nAs extension of this work, we would like to analyse the effectiveness of the solution not only in terms of guidance but also for teaching more complicated tasks, e.g., how to move in a cluttered environment, as well as compare the proposed mixed-input approach with a haptic shared control method that changes the haptic feedback based on the measured robot and user confidence. The confidence metric introduced in this work can be then tested and validated in other robotic applications, such as drone navigation in cluttered environments.\\n\\nThe proposed workplan consists of\\n- Orientation and understanding of the problem: analysis and review of the relevant literature to\\nunderstand the control authority problem in the domain of robot shared-control strategies.\\n(Month 1).\\n- Preliminary hands-on session: familiarization with the experimental setup, the robotic\\nmanipulator arm, the haptic interface and the existing software for the robotic cutting task.\\n- First preliminary experiments to collect new data to be analysed (M2).\\n- Solution enhancement and first experimental campaign: Implementation and validation of\\npossible improvements that could enhance the proposed shared-control solution for the robotic\\ncutting task.

Although, multi-robot systems have experienced a surge in popularity, there is no standard solution to deploy such system with human shared autonomy. Humans can provide supervision and decision for the team extending the resilience of the team during long missions. Therefore, the objective will be to provide the software tools to deploy multiple robots, make them cooperate and allows the use user to define the mission plan. Moreover, the rise of Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-4 allows to predict possible high-scale plans with human common sense knowledge for the whole team in an almost instantaneus time. The prediction may be inaccurate but the computational advantages are tempting for practical applications. The candidate will investigate the application of models such as GPT-4 to conduct different multi-robot planning tasks with human operator feedback. In practice, the user should act at the prompt level to achieve the goal prescribed given a set of available actions, precoded functions to call, interacting in a human-like textual or vocal conversation. The output of this conversation must be automatically interpreted in a set of executable actions.\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Ability to analyse and synthesise \\n- Problem solving \\n- Critical and self-critical abilities \\n- Ability to learn \\n- Ability to generate new ideas (creativity) \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\nhttps://cmi.univ-rennes.fr/en/housing\\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nAt least 1 meeting per week\\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\nNone\\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n- Applied science  /  Engineering and technology \\n\\n- Formal science  /  Computer science \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nMaster or PhD\\n",

By moving this focal point fast enough, it is the possible to spread the energy along the trajectory, and therefore haptically stimulate the hand if it is close enough [2]. These interfaces can thus generate tactile stimuli in mid-air, without the need for any wearable equipment. \\n \\nIn addition, tactile feedback is often used as a means to convey information (e.g. texture, force, ...) through touch. With a UMH interface, we can represent this information using the shape of the stimulus and it’s set of rendering parameters. It is therefore important to understand how well we can discriminate between several tactile stimuli, using different parameters. In terms of geometry, shapes can for instance vary in position, rotation and scale. While the discrimination in position [3] and rotation [3, 4] has been partially investigated, scale has received less interest. \\n \\nAmong the many possibilities, circular patterns are often used because of their geometric and perceptual properties (e.g. rotation invariance, area maximisation for a given perimeter, ...) [5, 6]. It is therefore important to study our performance in discriminating tactile circles of different sizes, in order to optimise their rendering. \\n \\nThis project consists of several steps: \\n- Getting familiar with ultrasound mid-air haptic rendering. \\n- Determinin which discrimination strategies can be used by participants to try to discriminate between two stimuli. This will allow us to design experiments where only geometric cues can be used. \\n- Designing, implementing, and conducting user studies to measure human discrimination performance for circles of different sizes. \\n- Analyzing the obtained data to verify our hypotheses and compute perceptual metrics. \\n- Depending on the remaining time and the quality of the results, we may write and submit a scientific paper. \\n \\n[1] Rakkolainen, I., Freeman, E., Sand, A., Raisamo, R., &amp; Brewster, S.

Due to its highly aromatic and apolar structure, lignin is supposed to be hard to degrade by soil microbial communities and to accumulate in soils, notably in waterlogged wetland soils. Consequently, wetland soils are today considered as major carbon sinks and play a major role in the global carbon cycle and in climate change mitigation strategies. However, recent work on environmental archaeal phyla, such as Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methermicoccus shengliensis and two stable enrichments of representatives of the class Bathyarchaeia, evidenced novel metabolic pathways to specifically degrade lignin in marine anoxic settings with comparable geochemical functioning as wetlands. This finding could challenge the assumed capacity of anoxic settings, such as wetlands, to sequester high amounts of organic carbon. The objective of this internship is to test the presence of these specific lignin degradation pathways in soils collected in a wetland of the Ploemeur-Guidel critical zone observatory (56, Brittany). Previous metagenomic analysis of these soils revealed high abundances of the recently-discovered archaeal taxon Ca. Bathyarchaeia and comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of genomes assembled from these metagenomes predicted the presence of the enzymes catalyzing lignin degradation. The work will be based on the stable isotope probing technique where 13C-enriched lignin-based substrates are provided to soil incubations. Incorporation of the labeled 13C within the biomass of Ca. Bathyarchaeia will be assessed by the analysis of the carbon isotopic composition of archaeal lipid biomarkers by gas-chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS).\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n-\\tAbility to work in an interdisciplinary team \\n-\\tAbility in organising and planning\\n-\\tAbility to analyse and synthesise \\n-\\tAbility to adapt to new situations \\n-\\tAbility to work autonomously\\n-\\tProblem solving\\n-\\tConcern for quality\\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\n- Link on how to find an accomodation in Rennes : https://cmi.univ-rennes.fr/en/housing\\n- An office and a computer will be provided as well as all the necessary furniture. \\n- The trainne will receive a specific training in health &amp; safety regulations in the lab.\\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nThe trainee will be co-supervised by an assistant professor (S.

Most of the time, in such collaborative missions, the field of interest is relatively large with respect to the size of the multi-robot system. Therefore, the swarm must be divided into smaller groups (clusters) to move towards different areas and conduct different tasks simultaneously.\\nMotivations: Most of the current works addressing the problem of clustering for multi-agent systems are concerned with generic unconstrained agents, thus neglecting the constraints and specificity of networks of mobile robots in terms of limited sensing capabilities. Moreover, they only study the conditions for convergence of the agents to small groups, i.e. cluster consensus, rather than the autonomous formation of clusters. There are few works addressing the autonomous achievement of clusters in a network of mobile robots based on distributed and local interactions among the robots, none of which take also into account the sensing constraints inherent to these types of systems.\\nGeneral Objectives: The goal of this Master Thesis is to design and validate theoretically (using Lyapunov methods, graph theory, etc.) novel control laws for the autonomous achievement of cluster consensus of a swarm of robotic vehicles subject to sensing constraints (limited range, limited field of view) based on local and distributed interaction laws among the robots. The work done during the internship will be validated in simulation and experimentally using a fleet of Crazyflie drones.\\n\\nEnvisaged Activities:\\n- Literature review of the related works and familiarize with the experimental setup in the team.\\n- Take over the existing works and work on the design and analysis of a control algorithm for autonomous cluster consensus of multi-robot systems\\n- Implement and validate in simulation the proposed algorithms.\\n- Validate experimentally the scenario on a fleet of Crazyflie drones.\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Teamwork \\n-  Ability to work in an international context \\n-  Ability to generate new ideas (creativity) \\n-  Ability to work autonomously \\n-  Problem solving \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\nhttps://cmi.univ-rennes.fr/en/housing\\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nMeeting frequency with supervisor: at least once a week.\\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\n- High motivation and interest in the topic \\n\\n- Good knowledge in control theory and robot modeling \\n\\n- Good experience using Matlab/Simulink \\n\\n- Basic knowledge of control and analysis of multi-agent systems is appreciated \\n\\n- Previous experience with Python/C++ and ROS2 is appreciated \\n\\n- Scientific curiosity \\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n- Applied science  /  Engineering and technology \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nMaster level 1\\nMaster level 2\\n",

While a fixed number of cooperative robotic agents may be capable of performing “simple” short-term tasks such as, e.g., formation tracking, flocking, or area coverage, it may prove limiting in many practical scenarios. Indeed, as the field advances, applications of multi-robot systems are starting to shift from such relatively simple tasks, to more complex long-term and persistent missions that require the robots to be deployed for longer periods of time, usually surpassing the battery-charge duration of the devices, forcing individual robots to leave the network for recharging and (possibly) returning when fully charged. Moreover, as tasks get more complex and are designed for dynamic and, often, antagonistic environments, failure of individual robots due to malfunctioning or attacks cannot always be prevented. Equivalently, when addressing tasks in uncertain or unknown environments, in order to successfully accomplish the mission, new robots may be required to join the system dynamically as the task specification or the environment evolve. Usually during the development of a mission both the addition and removal of agents are bound to happen, oftentimes, simultaneously.\\nAn Open Multi-Robot System (OMRS) is a system of multiple cooperative robots where agents can be added or removed. Recently, in our team we have started considering the coordination of OMRS in an passivity-aware framework [1] based on the concepts of impulsive switched systems, passivity, and energy-tanks, that allows the OMRS to handle the addition and removal of agents (or groups thereof) autonomously while preserving the passivity of the system.\\nGeneral Objectives: The goal of this Master Thesis is to build upon the passivity-aware coordination framework for OMRS to design a complex and long-term mission on a fleet of quadrotor UAVs, e.g., a long-term surveillance and target-tracking mission, and implement it in simulation and experimentally.\\nEnvisaged Activities:\\n- Literature review of the related works and familiarize with the experimental setup in the team.\\n- Design a long-term mission scenario based on the open Multi-agent system framework for a fleet of UAVs.\\n- Develop and implement in simulation an algorithm for the proposed mission.\\n- Setup the experimental scenario and validate the algorithms on a fleet of Crazyflie drones.\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Teamwork \\n- Ability to work in an international context \\n- Ability to generate new ideas (creativity) \\n- Ability to work autonomously \\n- Problem solving \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\n- Link on how to find an accomodation in Rennes :\\nhttps://cmi.univ-rennes.fr/en/housing\\n- Access to sports facilities on campus \\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nMeeting frequency with supervisor: at least once a week \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\n- High motivation and interest in the topic \\n\\n- Good knowledge in control theory and robot modeling \\n\\n- Good experience using Python/C++, ROS2 and Matlab/Simulink \\n\\n- Basic knowledge of control and analysis of multi-agent systems is appreciated \\n\\n- Scientific curiosity \\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n- Applied science  /  Engineering and technology \\n\\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nMaster level 1\\nMaster level 2\\n",

Tissue biopsies remain the gold standard to profile these markers for most cancers. However, the procedure is invasive, painful and carries some risks. Therefore, complementary applications using non-invasive biomarkers are of great interest. Liquid biopsies better cover disease heterogeneity and allow serial sampling. This helps to better characterize the molecular profile of the tumor and follow disease evolution. \\nTumor cells, like other cells in the body; release extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing various molecules such as RNAs and proteins. These EVs can be found in all body fluids, such as blood, and emerged as potential circulating biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of treatment response since they reflect the molecular events occurring in the tumor. The aim of this study is to determine the clinical value of circulating RNAs, associated or not to EVs, for better patient management.  \\nThe internship will be dedicated to define an optimized and reproducible protocol to isolate EVs from plasma with a high efficiency and a low contamination in lipoproteins. This will include characterization of EVs by Western Blot and NanoTracking Analysis. Finally, once the SEC protocol will be optimized, we will investigate RNAs in EV-enriched and unprocessed plasma to determine the best source of transcript biomarkers.  \\n \\nKeywords: extracellular vesicles, circulating biomarkers, liquid biopsies, transcripts cancers \\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Ability in organising and planning \\n- Ability to apply knowledge in practice  \\n- Concern for quality  \\n- Ability to work autonomously  \\n- Ability to analyse and synthesise \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\nhttps://cmi.univ-rennes.fr/en/housing\\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nAt least 1 meeting per week \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\n- Vaccinations against hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus and polyomyelitis is mandatory \\n- Background in oncology, biochemistry and molecular biology \\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\nApplied science  /  Medicine and health (molecular biology/cell biology) \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nMaster level 1\\nMaster level 2\\n",

These observations, combined with in situ measurements, provide invaluable information on the chemical and physical conditions prevailing during the formation of the solar system. The density of cometary atmospheres is such that thermodynamic equilibrium cannot be systematically maintained. It is therefore important to study the collisional excitation of cometary molecules induced by heavy projectiles such as CO, CO2 or H2O, in order to make the most of the observations. In this project, we propose to use new methods for obtaining these data. Centrifugal decoupling methods and especially statistical approaches will be the methods of choice for such studies, as they keep computation times reasonable while offering relatively accurate data. In parallel, we will introduce the new data into radiative transfer codes with the aim of interpreting recent and future observations of cometary atmospheres, and thus making the most of these observations. \\n\\nKeywords: astrochemistry, comets, quantum physics\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Elementary computer skills \\n- Ability to generate new ideas (creativity) \\n- Ability to work in an international context \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\n- Link on how to find an accomodation in Rennes : https://cmi.univ-rennes.fr/en/housing  \\n- Access to sports facilities on campus \\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\n- On site training\\n\\n- Frequent group meetings \\n\\n- Co-supervision by PhD students \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\nNone\\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n\\n- Natural science  /  Chemistry\\n- Natural science  /  Physics \\n- Natural science  /  Astronomy \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nMaster level 1\\nMaster level 2\\n",

The work will be supervised jointly by Tristan Allard (PhD, HDR) associate professor at the University of Rennes, expert in privacy in data intensive systems, and Barbara FILA (PhD, HDR), associate professor at INSA Rennes, expert in formal methods for risk assessment. \\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\nContext :\\nLarge volumes of personal data are nowadays collected by private companies or public organisations. Typical examples include health records, geolocation, electricity consumption, or social networks. Various legal, monetary, or visibility incentives encourage data holders to share anonymized versions of the collected datasets. On the one hand, data publishing is useful because it allows to strengthen scientific studies, to favor industrial innovation, or to establish appropriate public policies. Numerous open data repositories are well known today and their number keeps growing. On the other hand, publishing personal data must be done with \\ncare in order to provide strong privacy guarantees. Failing to safeguard privacy may lead to severe consequences on individuals or companies. To preserve privacy, privacy-preserving data publishing techniques are used. Today’s typical techniques include ad-hoc aggregation, k-anonymous generalization [3, 4], or differentially private perturbation [1]. Their aim is to ensure that the published data enjoy (hopefully strong enough) privacy guarantees. Security is \\nhowever a constant race between the attackers and the defenders. A large number of attacks on privacy-preserving data publishing algorithms exists today and keeps growing [2]. \\n \\nObjective :\\nThe objective of this project is to develop a formal framework (see, e.g., [6]) allowing to analyze risks relevant to privacy-preserving data publishing (see, e.g., [5]). \\n \\nThe tasks of the student will be to: \\n- Perform a systematic analysis of the state of the art on existing privacy-preserving data publishing techniques and related attacks. \\n- Analyze existing attacks in order to identify aspects and/or parameters (e.g., privacy loss, usability, attacker’s background knowledge) that should be taken into account while analyzing the risks relevant to a privacy-preserving data publishing technique. \\n- Propose a taxonomy of relevant attackers, based on aspects such as adversarial goals, background knowledge, reasoning methods, computational capabilities, etc. \\n- Develop a model allowing to evaluate privacy risks in the personal data publishing context. \\n \\nReferences :\\n[1] Cynthia Dwork.

Collagen is the structural protein par excellence, and is used throughout the animal kingdom as the main constituent of tissues ranging from bone and skin to cornea. The mechanical properties of collagen are highly variable and can be adapted to the function of the tissue it constitutes. Mechanical properties are controlled at the nanoscopic scale by the protein&#039;s amino acid sequence, its level of cross-linking and its degree of hydration. But that&#039;s not all - there are other ingredients missing! At present, the molecular models used to simulate collagen properties are not mechanically stable, and collagen structure degrades or disassembles under conditions of ambient pressure and temperature. However, collagen - and therefore our skin - is stable under these conditions. The structure of collagen is therefore still a matter of debate [1]. \\n\\nThe aim of the internship will be to refine an existing molecular model of fibrillar collagen  which is currently unstable due to existing internal stresses. Work will consist in including macromolecules and cross-links to our current molecular model. The improved model will then be simulated using a molecular dynamics approach to study the stability of the tertiary structure and predict the mechanical properties of fibrillar collagen. \\n\\nThe simulation tool is based on existing tools: (i) reliable interatomic potentials obtained at the quantum scale to establish the interactions between atoms, and (ii) an optimized molecular dynamics simulator (LAMMPS). Once the tool has been established, parallelized simulations will be carried out on high-performance computers, with detailed analysis to determine the relationships between composition, structure and viscoelastic properties. \\n\\n[1] Orgel, J.

However, this balance can be disrupted by various endogenous or exogenous factors, leading to intestinal dysbiosis (diseases). Intestinal dysbiosis is a modification in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which may be correlated with the onset of certain intestinal pathologies, such as Crohn&#039;s disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes or colorectal cancer. Bacteria such as Salmonella are increased and persist in the intestine, while other commensal bacterial species are reduced, such as Bacteroides fragilis, Roseburia intestinalis and Akkermansia muciniphila, which are considered to be potential new generation probiotics. These potential new-generation probiotics can produce bacterial metabolites with beneficial effects in the intestine and other organs. However, mechanisms remain to be elucidated, in particular the study of the effects of a probiotic community on the intestinal epithelium, pathogenic bacteria and inflammation. \\n\\nThe project of the internship will focus on studying the metabolic behavior of several gut bacterial species alone or in community to mimic gut microbiota. At first, we will evaluate the capacity of bacteria to growth, to produce metabolites. After that, we will investigate the impact of these bacteria or their metabolites on host by using an original model, mimicking the intestinal epithelium, that we have developed in the Numecan Institut.  \\n\\nThe methods that will be developed are: Bibliography search, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture, cell culture (complex model composed of 5 human cell lines), RT-qPCR, trans-epithelial resistance measurement, toxicity measurement, GC-MS for metabolites).\\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Ability to analyse and synthesise  \\n- Ability to apply knowledge in practice  \\n- Teamwork  \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\n\\n- Link on how to find an accomodation in Rennes : https://cmi.univ-rennes.fr/en/housing  \\n- Access to sports facilities on campus \\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nNo allowance\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nEvery day \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\n- Knowledge in microbiology and cellular culture \\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n- Applied science  /  Medicine and health  \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\nBachelor or Master\\n",

        "description": "**Duration of the internship**\\n5 to 6 months\\n\\n**Hours per week**\\n35 hours\\n\\n**Preferred start date**\\nNo preference \\n\\n**Preferred end date**\\nNo preference \\n\\n**Further information about host organisation and relevant links**\\nThe candidate will work in the joined Inria / IRISA research centre located in Rennes. Inria (www.inria.fr) and IRISA (http://www.irisa.fr) are amongst the leading research centres in Computer Sciences in France. The work will be supervised by members of the VirtUs team, internationally recognised in the fields of Computer Graphics, Virtual Human Simulation, and Virtual Reality.  \\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\nInteractions with other persons are ubiquitous in our daily lives, ranging from social interactions in personal and professional situations, to physical interactions, e.g. in sports. For this reason, researchers have striven for years to understand, model, and repliquate humans to include them in digital replicas, with impressive advancements made in topics such as capturing, rendering, animating, etc. Realistic virtual humans are therefore now common in entertainment applications (e.g., movies, videogames), but have also demonstrated their value in other fields such as architecture, trainging, education, etc.  \\n\\n\\nRecently, realistic virtual humans have also started to be more and more used in immersive Virtual Reality applications in order to study human behaviours. Because of the complexity of studying human behaviours in controlled real situations, being able to immerse users in virtual replicas populated with interactive virtual humans provides a novel paradigm to explore such questions. For instance, VR was used to compare pairwise interactions between real and virtual situations [Olivier et al. 2018], to explore when pedestrians choose to go through or around groups of characters [Bruneau et al. 2015], to explore the relation between gaze activity and collision avoidance during pedestrian interactions [Berton et al. 2019, 2020], or to explore exit choices during evacuations [Ríos and Pelechano 2020]. It was even recently used to crowd datasets by immersing only one single user, successively embodying several virtual agents by him/herself [Yin et al. 2022, 2024]. \\n\\n \\n\\nHowever, immersive VR applications can have limitations in the level of realism and variety of scenarios that can be explored, because of the time and budget constraints required to develop a variety of scenarios. Instead, Augmented Reality could provide an interesting alternative to automatically deploy out-of-the-lab and in-the-wild applications directly in real situations. For instance, one could imagine using Augmented Reality to plan the organization of real events and evaluate the effects of specific arrangements on various crowd-related characteristics (e.g., evacuation, bottlenecks, flows), by automatically populating real places with virtual characters. Nevertheless, including virtual characters in AR applications, in particular involving large virtual crowds, is still challenging. It requires to include them in appropriate locations, depending on the topology of the environment that varies depending on the real scene. This becomes even more difficult when these characters are animated, as they should act according to the environment, and potentially interact with real humans that will be also present. While some attempts have been made at simulating virtual crowds in AR [Akaydın et al. 2013, 2014 ; Hürst and Geraerts 2019], these have only targeted extremely simple setups, and not complex real world situations, or for specific studies (e.g., pedestrian interaction with a virtual car in AR [Maruhn et al. 2020]). Furthermore, it is still unclear whether to which degree interactions with virtual humans in AR differ from interactions in real situations.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe goal of this internship is therefore to explore and evaluate user interactions with virtual characters in AR applications. The first objective will consist in developing an experiment where users will be able to interact with a few animated characters in AR, in particular to evaluate potential differences to existing situations already studied in VR (e.g., dyadic interactions). Then, the second objective will be to explore the potential use of AR to study interactions with larger virtual crowds, which will introduce a number of constraints (in terms of the number of characters that can be animated, their inclusion in the real scene, the semantic of their interactions with the scene, etc.). The experiments and applicationd developed will be based on some of the tools already developed in the Virtus team for crowd simulation, character animation, and immersive virtual crowds, such as CrowdMP and Umans.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThis internship therefore involves :\\n\\n-\\tDeveloping a framework for the animation and simulation of virtual characters in AR \\n\\n-\\tDeveloping a number of simple scenarios of increasing complexity involving user interactions with virtual characters in AR  \\n\\n-\\tEvaluating potential differences in user interactions with virtual characters in AR, in comparison to real or purely virtual situations. \\n\\n**Description of skills and competencies to be developed**\\n- Elementary computer skills  \\n- Ability to work in an interdisciplinary team  \\n- Ability to work autonomously  \\n- Ability to analyse and synthesise  \\n- Ability in organising and planning  \\n\\n**Host organisation support: logistic support**\\n- Link on how to find an accomodation in Rennes : https://cmi.univ-rennes.fr/en/housing\\n- Access to sports facilities on campus \\n\\n**Host organisation support: financial support**\\nAllowance of €4.35 per hour\\n\\n**Host organisation support: mentoring conditions**\\nWeekly meetings \\n\\n**Additional requirements**\\nNone\\n\\n**Application process**\\nNot listed\\n\\n**Field of studies**\\n- Applied science  /  Engineering and technology \\n\\n**Level of studies**\\n- Master level 1\\n- Master level 2",

Accordingly, their sensorimotor capabilities are essential and largely determine the activities that robots can perform. In recent years, great progress has been made in sensory capabilities (especially in perception), thanks to significant dvances in machine learning (ML) and dedicated ML hardware. In contrast, much less progress has been made in the area of motor skills. In the current state of the art, one of the most promising approaches is Model Predictive Control (MPC), which forms the basis of the control architecture of most advanced dynamic robots.\\n\\nIn MPC, the control actions are optimized over a finite time horizon, considering the time evolution of robot dynamics to optimize a given cost or reward function that describes the robot motion. \\n\\n From a control point of view, the following properties should be fulfilled: (1) taking into account the actual morphology when modelling the dynamics of the robot, (2) a planning horizon that is as long as possible to be able to plan complex sequences and to take contacts with the environment into account and (3) a control frequency that is as high as possible to be able to meet the real-time conditions imposed by real-world physics and, if necessary, to replan the sequence of movements.\\n\\nUsing algorithm-specific hardware acceleration, which exploits the control approach&#039;s algorithmic properties, allows the implementation of safe real-time MPC with long prediction horizons and high control frequencies. However, the structure of the control algorithms is complex, and the algorithms are sensitive to numerical errors or reduced arithmetic precision. Furthermore, failures in the control algorithms can lead to catastrophic failures and unpredictable and possibly dangerous behaviors of the robot. Thus, it is necessary to apply a Hardware-Algorithm-Co-Design approach, i.e., to adapt the currently available control algorithms to the underlying hardware and to design the hardware in such a way that it is optimally suited for the control algorithms.\\n\\nIn the last years, domain-specific hardware acceleration (using GPUs or dedicated hardware) has become increasingly popular [1], [2], [3], [4]. Since GPU acceleration suffers from high power consumption and is not flexible, a recent promising approach is to consider dedicated accelerators, such as FPGAs or Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) [5], [6], [7]. \\n \\nSimilarly to GPU acceleration, FPGA designs for the computational kernels behind MPC, e.g. structured Quadratic Programming (QP) that has to be solved online and repeatedly, have been recently proposed [8]. Depending on the approach, the accelerator has to focus on various low-level linear algebra routines that compose the algorithm, such as matrix-vector multiplies, linear solvers, and matrix factorization.\\n\\nHowever, designing such accelerators is a challenging task, with the resulting architectures being often so specific to a particular problem instance [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], such that it is difficult to reuse them even with a related application within the same domain. Even when a general approach appears, it is usually geared for data center-level applications and does not necessarily translate easily to an embedded accelerator context. Many parallel implementations exist to accelerate MPC [14] as well as studies on accelerating MPC on FPGAs [7], [15], [16], [17]. In the very resource-constrained context of small-scale UAVs, even if FPGA platforms have been used to accelerate many aspects of UAVs, such as path planning, simultaneous localization and mapping, stereo vision, system stability, state estimation, target tracking, communications, obstacle avoidance, and interfacing with peripherals [18], MPC acceleration has not yet been demonstrated. Therefore, dedicated low-power hardware implementations are needed to push forward the limits of MPC algorithms on UAVs [19].\\n\\nEnvisaged Activities: \\nThe proposed MSc internship&#039;s objective is to design HW accelerators for UAV MPC algorithms, with the goal of improving accuracy, performance, power consumption, and silicon area. \\n\\nIn more detail, the candidate will:\\n- Study the state-of-the-art algorithms for UAV to identify HW acceleration opportunities (e.g., parallelization, pipelining).\\n\\n- Implement hardware accelerator(s) for the identified algorithms\\n\\n- Integration in the UAV platform, test, and result analysis\\n\\n- Publication of the results to an international workshop/conference\\n\\nMost importantly, we seek highly motivated candidates.\\n\\nRelated references: \\n[1] V.

        "description": "**Duration of the internship**\\n6 months\\n\\n**Hours per week**\\n35 hours\\n\\n**Preferred start date**\\nAs soon as possible \\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\nThe goal of this Master Thesis is the design and validation of novel aerial platforms for Aerial Physical Interaction and collaborative transportation.\\n\\nDescription: \\nAerial Physical Interaction (APhI) is a promising and challenging topic which raised the interest of academia and industry. The ability of interacting with the environment, together with the motion capabilities of drones, makes these platforms much more than aerial robots. Moreover, when multiple robots collaborate with each other, the redundancy of the group can be exploited to perform collaborative transportation in an agile way with a significant payload.\\n\\nMotivations: Most of the existing Aerial Physical Interaction  platforms were not designed from the beginning with end effectors to interact with the environment. Tools such as rigid sticks, serial or parallel robotic arms are added afterward to the aerial robot.  The tasks that such robots are able to perform, however, are much more complex than single drones not in interaction with the environment. A new design which takes into account from the beginning the tool(s) for physical interaction is therefore necessary to improve and optimize the performance from mechanical, electronic and energetic points of view. Moreover, also drones used for collaborative transportation are not designed and optimized for that task. A novel design with the final application in mind will improve them and drastically reduce their limitations.\\n\\nGeneral Objectives: The goal of this Master Thesis is the design and validation of novel aerial platforms for Aerial Physical Interaction and collaborative transportation. In particular, a new hexarotor with a robotic arm will be designed, optimizing both the mechanics and the onboard electronics, taking inspiration from the TiltHex platform already available in our team; a novel design of the robotic arm could also be considered, while for the moment we integrate a leg of the SOLO12 quadruped robot as an arm attached to the drone (see GitHub link below). Finally, a new design for the quadcopters used in the FlyCrane platform will be performed, considering the final task of cooperative transportation to optimize mechanical and electrical aspects.\\n\\nAvailable equipment :\\nWe have two drone arenas equipped with motion capture systems, used to fly several types of drones, from small Crazyflies to hexarotors (see images). A lab space with tools, soldering stations and 3D printers is also available. For static experiments, a robot room with several serial robotic arms is also available.\\n\\nEnvisaged Activities: \\nThe student will be introduced in the Rainbow Team and will work in collaboration with PhD students and research engineers.\\n\\n1. At first, the student will become familiar with the relevant literature on this subject (some references are listed below), with the software tools and with the platforms available in the team.\\n\\n2. Then, the student will take over the existing works and start designing and prototyping novel platforms.\\n\\n3. Finally, when promising prototypes will be obtained and tested in simulation, the student will validate them with real flights in the drone arenas\\n\\nRelated references: \\n- A. Ollero, M.

The physical interactions between UAVs, load and cables render collaborative manipulation a challenging task from both a planning and control perspective. Existing solutions require either quasi-static assumptions that limit the dynamic behaviour of the system, which limits their operational speeds; or neglect safety-related constraints such as cable tautness and non-collisions between UAVs. Therefore, this project envisions developing the next generation of multi-UAV systems to achieve fast, safe, and robust manipulation of a cable-suspended load in the real world. \\nIn this project, the student will collaborate with researchers from the University of Twente and the University of Catania, to develop and experimentally validate a novel theory based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and adaptive control.\\n\\nList of 5 bibliographical references:\\n\\n- Sun, S., &amp; Franchi, A.

For instance, when the load is not constant/fixed (e.g. deformable objects, loading/unloading by human operators) a constant team of robots might prove insufficient since the load could increase beyond the current team’s capabilities. On the other hand, when sharing the workspace with other teams of robots or humans, it is necessary to guarantee the safety of the systems and persons as well as its compliance to human guidance and manipulation.\\n\\nThe goal of this Master Thesis is to exploit recent advancements on the topic of energy-aware coordination of  multi-drone systems to handle collaborative load transportation in unknown and unstructured environments with a team of drones. Extensions to the case of safe shared human-multi-robot transportation could also be considered. The work done during the the internship will be validated in simulation and, if the time allows, experimentally using the drones available in the team.\\n\\nList of 5 bibliographical references:\\n\\n- F.

        "description": "**Duration of the internship**\\n6 months\\n\\n**Hours per week**\\n35 hours\\n\\n**Preferred start date**\\nAs soon as possible \\n\\n**Description of the tasks**\\n\\nA new torque-controlled arm is to be designed and implemented for the tilt-hex hexacopter platform in order to obtain a thrust-torque (optimal) control for the robot.\\n\\nDescription: \\nAerial manipulation [1] is a promising field of robotics research. Aerial manipulators are aerial robots (e.g., quadcopters) equipped with tools (e.g., robotic arms) able to interact with the environment, thus enhancing the capabilities of the robot and widening the possible tasks which can be performed. These inherently unstable and complex systems come with challenging design and control problems.\\n\\nPrevious designs of aerial manipulators [2] did not allow to control each actuator at the force/torque level, thus leading to slow and inaccurate tasks. The proposed Master Thesis faces this issue by designing and implementing a full-body control which considers both the dynamics of the aerial robot and the manipulator and leverages state of the art techniques such as QP-based control and MPC [4]. In particular, a new torque-controlled arm is to be designed and implemented for the tilt-hex hexacopter platform [5] (available in the Rainbow Team), in order to obtain a thrust-torque  (optimal) control for the robot.\\n\\nThe designed control system will be tested in the drone arena of the Rainbow Team, and the experimental results will be compared to the results of previous works in the aerial manipulation literature.\\n\\nList of 5 bibliographical references:\\n\\n- A.

One widely recognized model is the microbial fuel cell (MFC). Bacterial electroactivity involves cellular respiration using extracellular solids as electron donors or acceptors. \\nThis phenomenon, discovered in various ecological niches, is a growing interest in research towards the human microbiota, whose severe imbalance, known as dysbiosis, is often observed in many pathologies. Few explored until now, recent studies have shown that some bacteria in the intestinal microbiota are electroactive and capable of extracellular electron transfer2. \\n In this context, our project focuses on three intestinal bacterial strains, Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus reuteri. A. muciniphila, considered as a new-generation probiotic, is a strict anaerobic Gram-negative mucin-degrading bacterium, present at 3-5% in healthy microbiota. Its abundance in the human intestinal tract is drastically reduced under particular metabolic pathological conditions (obesity, type II diabetes...)3. On the contrary, its abundance increases in neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis4. Its high proliferation occurs at the expense of intestinal bacteria belonging, for example, to the genus Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, beneficial in a balanced microbiota. \\nIn previous work, we have demonstrated that Lactobacillus reuteri displays a redox step in the biotransformation of a dietary polyphenol, the 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid5. By the use of electrochemical tools, we have focused on the study of the electroactivity of Lactobacillus reuteri, and the setting of its MFC has confirmed its ability to exchange electrons with the extracellular environment. In sight, we intend to use non-targeted LC-HRMS² analysis to identify metabolites produced during redox activities by the bacteria in MFC. Screening of bacterial metabolites may also enable us to determine whether the electroactivity of certain bacteria is involved in metabolic pathways involved in the gut-brain axis, such as kynurenine or serotonin pathways and biotransformation of polyphenols.\\n\\nTASKS\\nMain activities: The candidate will be responsible for culturing several strains characteristic of the intestinal microbiota (including Lactobacillus reuteri, Bifidobacterium longum and Akkermansia muciniphila), setting up bacterial biopiles and measuring their electroactivity. He/she will draw up extraction protocols for the metabolites produced in the bacterial environment. \\nMinor activities: He/she will also participate in the characterisation of extracted metabolites by LC-HRMS/MS and GC-MS \\n\\nReferences \\n\\n(1) Kumar A., Hsu H.-H., Kavanagh P., Barrière F., Lens P.

With its focus on logical\\nconsistency, factual accuracy, originality of arguments and to some degree of emotional\\nappeal to the audience, debating develops the art of persuasion. It also expands our\\nunderstanding of different dilemmas and controversies in our society and gives us a\\nway of resolving our misunderstandings and conflicts in a peaceful manner.  It is also a great tool for non-native English language speakers, as it gives them an\\nopportunity to practice their English, improve their vocabulary and verbal\\ncommunication skills. A university with a debating society gains an active student body\\nand it adequately prepares its students for the challenges of today’s demanding labor\\nmarket and the complexity of the society we live in.

        "description": "#### Learning objectives\\n\\nIn the traditional historiographical narrative, the arrival of the “barbarians” corresponds to the end of the greatest civilization of the antique Mediterranean: the Roman Empire. But was the situation so simple? Who were these “barbarians”? And did the Empire really collapse or was it rather transformed? The goal of this course is to focus on the artistic, visual, material, and performative cultures that coexisted in this extraordinary moment of history. To reach this objective, we will firstly focus on the prejudices constructed from the Renaissance to our days about what was commonly considered as the “Dark Ages”. Secondly, we will be investigating the role of medias in the transformations of visual history: from sculptures to “bidimensional” images, from roll to codex, from the illusive image to the iconic one. Third, we will analyze the role played by the meeting of cultures – constitutive for the investigated period – in the birth of the “Middle Ages”.\\n\\nThis course is taught by the Department of Art History at Masaryk University. \\n\\nAt the end of the course participants will:\\n- be able to orientate himself in the visual and material cultures of the Late Antique to Early Medieval world;\\n- understand the tools and the importance of visual culture within social and historical phenomena;\\n- fall in love with art history!",

        "description": "Critical methodologies engage and problematize global approaches in social sciences, humanities, and cultural studies in dialogue with perspectives from the margins on research practice across disciplines and in cross-cultural contexts with regional and local cases in the global South and beyond. The course provides insights from research in interdisciplinary environments such as studies of urban space, critical heritage, migration, human rights, religion, music, and diversities. \\nThe course provides PhD students with new insights into critical methodologies aiming for dialogue across structural, physical, and disciplinary boundaries challenging binary thinking by learning and unlearning and thinking otherwise. Southern and decolonial perspectives imply a dialogue and critical interrogation of the politics of knowledge and research methodologies in various contexts across the world. We reflect critically on the politics and ethics of knowledge, research design and impact, inequalities, power relations, coloniality, intersectionality, positionality, reflexivity, and the unforeseen and failure in doing research.  \\n\\n## SKILLS \\nThe candidate: \\n- Formulates theoretically grounded problems using critical methodologies to plan and carry out interdisciplinary research in their own field at an international level. \\n- Employs and makes use of critical methodologies across social, political and cultural contexts, challenging established knowledge and practices in a way that qualifies for international, peer-reviewed publication. \\n- Can identify and analyze the need for knowledge development and change in established research approaches within the cross-cutting areas of social sciences and humanities. \\n\\n## GENERAL COMPETENCE \\nThe candidate:  \\n- Critically discusses and evaluates methodological questions in their own and others’ projects, communicating such evaluations to peers and the academic community. \\n- Can disseminate research results on critical methodologies and interdisciplinary research through national and international publication channels where academic production is scrutinized by critical peer-reviews. \\n- Can identify knowledge gaps and reformulate research questions in innovative ways that contribute to new thinking in critical methodologies in ways that are relevant to their research area and relevant fields of practice. \\n- Can identify ethical and political challenges in methodological approaches, conducting research with academic integrity. \\n- Can manage complex professional tasks in research, identifying struggles in dominant approaches and contributing to new thinking in research methodologies.",
